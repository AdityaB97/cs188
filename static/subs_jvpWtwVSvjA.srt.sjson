OK, let's look at some step by step examples for","the alpha-beta algorithm.","And just as a reminder, let me put on the slide the meaning","of alpha and beta.","Alpha is the best already-explored option along the path to the root for","the maximizer.","And beta is the equivalent for the minimizer, that is, the best","already-explored option along the path to the root for the minimizer.","OK, with this intuition in mind, let's now work through the alpha-beta","execution on this particular game three.","We start at the top node, the root of the tree.","This is a maximizer node, so the value gets initialized to be the worst case","for the maximizer, which is minus infinity.","And this node will explore it's children.","We do a left-right traversal, so first go down here.","So we'll pass out an alpha value and a beta value, which have these","meetings over here.","Looking at the path to the roof, this not itself is the root.","In that node, no options have been explored yet, so along the entire","path, no options have been explored.","So the best available options to the maximizer is no option.","So that's the worst case minus infinity, and same for the minimizer,","the worst case, which, for the minimizer is plus infinity.","Now we're at the first child here.","This is a minimizer node.","So the value gets initialized to the worst case for minimizer, which is","plus infinity.","It will start looking at its children.","It'll pass down an alpha value and a beta value.","Alpha and beta have the meanings shown over here.","So this case, we'll look at the path to the route.","No options have been explored yet along the path of the root.","So we still have minus infinity and plus infinity.","Then we're at the next node here.","This node is a maximizer node.","For maximizer nodes, we initialize our values to minus infinity.","It'll start exploring its children.","It'll pass down and alpha and a beta value, again, with the same","meaning over here.","So since no options have been explored yet, for maximizer or for minimizer,","or we have still minus infinity and plus infinity being passed down.","This node here's a leaf node.","The value is four.","The value gets passed back up.","This allows this maximizer node to update its value.","Four is better than minus infinity for the maximizer, so we have four now.","And before looking at its next children, this maximizer node decides","where it's even worth it to look at its next children.","And for that it checks the following condition.","It checks whether this value of four, the current value here,","is higher than beta.","If that's the case, then it doesn't need to look at any","further children here.","Well unfortunately, that's not the case.","The value v is smaller than beta.","So we still need to look at the children down here.","OK, so we go down here.","We have an alpha and beta.","Alpha, best option available to maximizer along the path to the root.","Well, the maximizer now has an option of four, right here.","So alpha is four.","Beta is the best option for the minimizer.","No options for the minimizer yet, so this is still plus infinity.","Get down here, this is a leaf node, the value is 6.","6 gets passed back up.","For the maximizer, six is better that four, so the value becomes four.","And that becomes the value of this node over here.","So six gets passed back up.","The minimizer node looks at the six and the plus infinity.","Six is better than plus infinity for to minimizer, so this becomes six.","Now the minimizer considers whether it's worth going down to look at its","other children.","In this case, just one other child.","To decide this, the minimizer will compare its current value, v, which is","six, with the best option available to the maximizer anywhere","higher up in the tree.","Well, the best option available to the maximizer, anywhere higher up in the","tree-- there is no such options.","It's minus infinity.","In fact, it's stored in this alpha over here.","So that means we don't get to prune.","We go down here, we have an alpha and beta value.","Alpha, it's always the best option for the maximizer along","the path to the root.","Now, here's where it's important that you look at the phrasing carefully.","It's about the best option along the path to the route, not the best option","the already has ever encountered before.","For the maximizer, the algorithm has already seen a six","and a four over there.","They don't matter, however, because they're not sitting along the path to","the route from this node.","So alpha is here minus infinity.","Beta, best option for the minimizer along the path to the root.","Minimizer has an option here, that option is six, so beta is six.","No we'll get to maximizer node over here.","Its value gets initialized to be minus infinity, passing down an alpha and a","beta value.","Alpha is the best option for the maximizer along the path to the root.","That's minus infinity, because there's no such option.","Beta is the best value for to minimizer.","There is one such option, it's six, so that's a 6 being passed down.","The value of the leaf node here is seven.","Seven gets passed back up.","Minus infinity gets replaced with seven because that's","better for the maximizer.","Now the maximizer checks.","Is it still worth checking my next children?","Well, to verify that, the maximizer will compare the value that it","currently has, seven, with the best a minimizer can guarantee, which is six,","the beta value.","That means if the maximizer can get seven here, the minimizer would never","let that happen.","And wherever that option is available on the path to the route, the","minimizer will prefer that option over this option, here, that could lead to","a seven or even worse, because the maximizer has even more options","available, which we haven't looked at yet.","Seven bigger than six.","Equivalently, we have the v bigger than beta.","That means we get to prune.","We don't have to go down this path.","We know that the value of this node is seven or higher.","We don't know how high, but it's seven or higher.","It's enough that we know it's seven or higher.","To pass that back up, we pass up the seven or higher.","The minimizer compares the seven with the six, six is better, this was the","last child, so we have a value of six here.","This six gets passed back up to the root of the tree.","That's a maximizer between minus infinity and six.","It'll be for a six, the minus infinity disappears, we get a six here.","OK, now this node here has to decide whether it's worth it to explore any","further children.","To do that, it'll check and compare the current value six with the best","option available to the minimizer anywhere higher up in the tree.","Well, minimizer has no options higher up in the tree.","So that's no reason for the minimizer to deviate from getting here-- no","option to do so.","So we still need to go down.","The alpha value here is the best option for the maximizer so far.","The best option for the maximizer is to go down this path and","would attend a six.","Beta is the best option for the minimizer, no options for the","minimizer yet, so that's plus infinity.","Now we're at a minimizer node.","We'll initialize with plus infinity.","Then it'll look at its first child.","It'll pass down an alpha and a beta, same meaning as they've always had,","best option is available along the path to the root","for each of the players.","For alpha, that's six, for beta that's still plus infinity because no past","have been explored for the minimizer along the path to the root.","Now we're at this node here.","We initialize the value to minus infinity.","That's the worst case for the maximizer.","And we start exploring its first child, passing down an alpha and a","beta value.","Alpha fills six here.","Beta plus infinity, then look at this node.","The value of leaf node is one.","The one gets passed back up.","The maximizer says one is better than what I currently had, so I replace","minus infinity with one.","Now the question is, do I still need to explore any remaining children?","To decide that what the maximizer does, it compares its current value,","one, with options already available to minimizer anywhere along","the path to the route.","There are no such option for the minimizer, so there is no such","possibility of pruning here.","So we have to go down this path here.","We pass down a alpha value and a beta value.","Alpha is the best option for the maximizer.","The maximizer had a six and has a one.","Among those two six is best, alpha a six, beta is best","option for the minimizer.","Along the path to the root, well, no options have been explored yet.","So still plus infinity.","Coming down here, we see two, we pass the two back up.","We compare the two with the one.","Well, two is better than one, so the value here is two.","The two gets passed up to this minimizer node.","Two is better than plus infinity for the minimizer, so we make this two.","Now we need to contemplate whether we need to still explore other children","of the minimizer.","To decide on this, we look at the current value for the minimizer, here,","which is two.","We compare with the best option available to the maximizer, which is","stored in alpha, which is sitting right here.","And we have six.","Well, the maximizer has a better option available than two--","six.","The minimizer here has an option to force a two, and then has other","options for which we don't know yet what the value will be.","But we do know the minimizer could potentially force a two.","And if it's going to take another option than the two, it's going to be","even worse for the maximizer.","That means the maximizer would never let the game get down here because","that two is worse than the six it could guarantee by veering the game","off to the left.","So we don't have to look at this part of the tree because no matter what the","values are there, all it can do is make the value of this node here","smaller than two.","Whatever value is smaller than two, doesn't matter.","Two or smaller always means the maximizer would","never take this option.","So we have a value here smaller than or equal to two for the node.","We pass back up the two.","The maximizer compares that two with the six it has, and it says,","well, six is better.","So I retain my value of six.","The maximizer then, again, has to make a decision.","Is it worth exploring any next children.","To make that decision, it compares it's current value, which is six, with","the best option available to the minimizer on the path to the root.","But that path to the root is empty.","There are no such options for the minimizer.","So I have to go down this path.","Passing down alpha and beta, try the best options available for a maximizer","or minimizer along the path to the root.","Well, maximizer at the route as an option of six.","That's the only option, so it's the best option.","The minimizer has no options.","So we have plus infinity here.","We'll look at this node here.","This is a minimizer node.","We visualize its value to plus infinity.","And it'll look at first child.","We'll pass down an alpha and a beta value.","Alpha is, again, best option for the maximizer along the path to the","root, that's 6.","Beta, similarly, for the minimizer, that's plus infinity.","This node initializes itself to maximizer,","initializes to minus infinity.","It'll look at his first child.","First child get passed an alpha and a beta value.","The values are six and plus infinity.","That child is a leaf node, so just pass that value back up.","The maximizer prefers eight over minus infinity.","So the current estimate is eight.","Now, before it starts looking at its next children, it has to decide","whether that's even needed.","It will compare eight with the best option the minimizer could potentially","force higher up in the tree.","So we look higher up in the tree.","No options have been explored for the minimizer yet, so no pruning.","Equivalently, we compare that eight with beta, which is the best option","available to the minimizer higher up in the tree.","Beta is plus infinity.","So eight is a lower value, so no pruning.","We go down this path.","Pass down an alpha and beta, alpha is the best option for the maximizer,","which is now eight, which is obtained by going here.","And for the minimizer, best option is still no options","available, so plus infinity.","We have a value of one.","Pass the one back up to an eight and one.","Eight is the better one, so we retain eight and the value of","this node is eight.","We pass the eight back up for here.","The minimizer compares eight with plus infinity.","Eight is better.","So the current value is eight.","Then the minimizer decides whether or not it's worth going down to look at","its next children.","It looks at its value, eight.","It compares it with options available to the maximizer","higher up in the tree.","The best options available to the maximizer higher up in the tree is","alpha, which is six.","Eight is better than six, so the maximizer might let the","game come over here.","So we need to explore what exactly the value is over here.","So we go down, look at the next child of the minimizer.","Alpha is best option for the maximizer on the path to the root.","So that's six here.","And beta is the best value available to the minimizer on the path to the","root, and that's eight.","Coming to this maximizer node here, initializing its","value to minus infinity.","Look at its first child, passing down an alpha value of six, a","beta value of eight.","Eight's child here is a leaf node with a value of nine.","So nine gets passed back up.","The maximizer prefers nine over minus infinity.","So we have nine here for now.","Then to decide whether or not it's worth going down this path here, the","maximizer has to look at what the minimizer has available to itself.","Well, on the path of the root, the minimize had an option of eight.","Namely over here, if the minimizer had gone to the left, the value of the","game would be eight.","Since the maximizer here is able to achieve nine, and maybe higher, thanks","to unexplored options, which could only increase the value for the","maximizer, or minimizer would veer off to the eight, rather than letting it","get to a place where the maximizer could get nine or maybe even better","for the maximizer.","So we don't need to consider what's down here.","This can be pruned.","We know that value of this node for the maximizer is at least nine.","We know enough.","We pass up the nine.","The minimizer retains the eight, eight is better than nine for the minimizer.","Then this eight gets passed back up.","The maximizer at the top compares eight and six.","Eight is better.","And so we have here, the value of the game to be eight.","And that's it.",""]}
