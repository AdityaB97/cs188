So if we have an arc X to Y, we're talking about variables X and","Y, and that arc is either consistent or not.","And what it means for an arc to be consistent is, essentially, there","aren't any constraint violations lurking there.","What's that mean?","It means that for every value in the tail x, there is some y in the head","which can be assigned without violating a constraint.","Let's see an example.","So here we could look at this constraint.","This is the constraint that goes from the Northern","Territory to Western Australia.","And we look at this and we check our definition.","Is there a problem here?","Is it the case that for every x in the tail there is some y in the head that","can be assigned without violating a constraint?","OK, well, what about for blue?","If we put blue in the tail, can we pick something at Western","Australia and be OK?","Sure, we pick red.","We actually have no choice at the head.","How about if we pick red at Northern Territory?","Well, now we have a problem.","This constraint is not consistent.","I could make it consistent.","How could I make it consistent?","Red is the problem.","I could get rid of the red.","And now it would become consistent.","So it wasn't consistent before, I can make it consistent by deleting values","from the tail.","So that I now have the property that anything in the tail can extend","satisfactorily to the head.","How about this one?","So here we have Queensland in the upper right,","looking at Western Australia.","Now here, every single value I can try in the tail can extend to an","assignment to the head without violating a constraint.","So this arc is consistent.","I don't have to do anything to make it consistent.","So how do you remember this?","Is this directional notion?","The arc's going in the other direction too and they may or may not be","consistent in the other direction.","An arc is a directed thing, it's either consistent or not.","And the way you make it consistent is you delete stuff from the tail.","How do you remember that?","Well, l like to think about it this way.","Let's say that you're pulled over by the constraint satisfaction police.","Well, what are they going to do?","They're going to check your trunk and they're going to make sure there's","nothing in there that's illegal.","And so the idea with making an arc consistent is you're going to look at","all the stuff in the trunk, that's the tail of the arc, and if anything in","there is causing a problem, meaning if you assigned it there would be no way","to satisfy that arc, you're going to pull it out and delete it.","This should help you remember you always delete from the tail of an arc.","Of course, the arc goes in the other direction and you'll get the other","direction too at some point in these algorithms.","All right, so what's forward checking?","What does forward checking do?","Well, if we assigned Western Australia, we would check everything","adjacent to it.","So we check the Northern Territory and Southern Australia.","And for each of those, we delete anything that violates a constraint","against our assignment.","So in essence, forward checking is just looking at the arcs that point","towards our new assignments, in this case WA, and enforcing their","consistency.","Now, of course, forward checking is a pretty intuitive thing.","We don't have to think about it like this.","But it is just enforcing the consistency of the incoming arcs.",""]}
