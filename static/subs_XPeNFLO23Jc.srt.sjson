So today we're going to be adding to this the","idea of informed search.","And informed search, we're going to add one key idea, which is in addition","to whatever else the search algorithm is doing, we're going to have a","function that let's look at a state and see whether or not we're kind of","hot or cold, are we getting close to the goal?","OK.","And there are good heuristics and bad heuristics.","We'll talk about how that all works today.","But this is the key idea in informed search, something tells you not just","is it a goal or not, but are you getting close.","","PROFESSOR: So the key object is a search heuristic.","What is a search heuristic?","It is not what you think of when you think of the word heuristic.","So just like we use rational in a very specific way, we use heuristic in a","very specific way.","In common language a heuristic is a rule of thumb.","It's kind of a generic plan that you should generally follow--","like look both ways before you cross the street.","A heuristic for us is something completely different in","terms of its structure.","A heuristic is a function.","It takes a state of the world and it returns a number.","So it's a function from states to numbers.","It doesn't tell you what to do.","It doesn't tell you to look both ways before you cross the street.","It just tells you whether or not you're close to a goal.","The heuristic, unlike a search algorithm which just does its thing--","successor functions.","It doesn't know whether it's a pathing problem or a pancake problem.","The heuristic knows exactly what's going on in your search problem.","And it knows about things like positions and pancakes.","So what does a heuristic do?","If can look at the state of the world and say, you're really, really far.","In that case it will return a big number.","It can say, oh, you're getting close to your goal.","In that case it's going to return a small number.","And you can already imagine how this will help us do a search.","We could prioritize on the fringe in areas where the heuristic tells us","we're kind of getting close.","So let's look at an example of a heuristic.","Here's a Pac-Man board.","If that's my search problem-- get to the dot--","then I want a function that looks at the state says how far I am.","Well, I don't know how far I am.","How could I find out how far I am?","I could run the search problem and find out.","Well that would defeat the whole point.","So I need some kind of general sense of whether or not I'm close.","Right?","How am I going to do that?","Well I could do something like, look at the Manhattan distance--","like this.","I could say, well in order to get there, if I ignore the walls, I need","to least go 10 to the left and then five down.","Maybe there's some walls in the way and I'll have to go further.","But more or less if I'm close to the dot, in general the Manhattan distance","will be smaller.","If I'm far, in general it will be bigger.","It's not perfect, but it's something.","And that's in general what heuristics are going to be.","They're not going to be perfect but they're going to be something.","You could use the Euclidean distance.","This is even less like the game because can't go on the diagonal.","But it's still the case that, however you get to that dot-- including the","fact that you can't move diagonally and the walls are going","to get in your way--","you still aren't any closer than 11.2.","So these are the kinds of things when we talk about a heuristic-- a function","from states to real numbers.","Here's another heuristic function.","Remember?","We were in Romania trying to get to the airport at Bucharest.","And there were a bunch of cities that we could drive between.","And one thing we could use as a heuristic of how far we would have to","drive along the roads, is what is the straight line distance from where we","are to our goal, which is Bucharest?","The graph isn't specific to the goal.","The heuristic is.","So in particular you'll notice things like, Bucharest is zero distance away","from Bucharest.","That's the kind of thing you want your heuristic to do.","You want to be zero at the goal.","And Arad, which is about as far as you get, is far.","And as you get closer--","so closer as this place Sibiu--","you can look it up, it's closer.","So the heuristic is generally telling us whether they're heading in the","right direction.","And this will help us build a better algorithm.","How about Pancakes?","Well now you're maybe going to start to see that heuristic functions are","not as simple as Euclidean distance on a map.","And then sometimes the map is Pac-Man, and sometimes the map is Romania, and","sometimes there are some things that are neither Pac-Man nor Romania.","Heuristic functions on pancakes is a little harder.","How could I know, say, from a given pancake stack, how far I am?","That's a little hard.","I know if it's right then I'm zero away.","But how about here?","How many weighted flip costs away am I?","I don't know.","So you would have to think really hard.","And one thing you might come up with is the number of the largest package","that's still out of place.","The idea being if, the fourth largest pancake is out of place--","wherever it is--","the only way to get it in place is to somehow get it to the top, and then","from the top flip the whole stack--","or four and above, if there's more than four.","So you can convince yourself that, in fact, this is a heuristic.","And the further I am from a solution in general, the bigger this number is.","We're going to talk later today more about how you come up with these","heuristics.","But the point is, it's not always Euclidean distance.","It is, however, always a function from states to real numbers.","And smaller means closer to the goal, in general."]}
