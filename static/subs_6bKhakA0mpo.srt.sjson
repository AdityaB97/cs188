So let's talk about probabilities.","This whole Expectimax thing isn't going to work unless we've got","probabilities in there that we know what to do with, we know what they","are, they represent the right thing.","And that's going to be a theme going forward in this course--","that we're going to need to be able to assign probabilities to various things","and do computations with them.","Let's remember what probabilities are.","So here's some key concepts.","We have this notion of a random variable.","A random variable is our way of representing an event","whose outcome is unknown.","However, while the outcome is unknown, we have a probability distribution,","which is an assignment of weights to the various outcomes.","See the example shown here on the right?","This is a model of traffic where traffic can take on three different","values, none light or heavy.","Notice this is already a model.","You might disagree.","You might want this to be a continuous value.","Density of cars, something like that.","I've made a modeling choice.","There are three outcomes here.","Given these three outcomes, I've picked one particular probability","distribution.","This probability distribution says, half the time there is light traffic,","a quarter of the time there is no traffic, and a quarter of the time","there is heavy traffic.","There are different possible choices for this distribution.","For example, if this road is the 880 with probability 1,","there's heavy track.","Now, these numbers that we assign have to obey certain laws.","We're going to get to more of this later, but for now, all we really need","is that the probabilities have to be non-negative, and they have to add up","to 1 over all of the options.","And these probabilities shown here obey that.","Now in general--","and we'll spend a lot of this course unpacking this idea--","we'll be computing these probabilities.","And as we get more evidence, the probabilities will change.","So for example, it may be that all else equal, the probability of heavy","traffic might be 20%, but the probability of heavy traffic at 8 AM","may be 60%.","And this process of, given information that we know, computing the","appropriate probabilities, is probabilistic inference, and we will","spend a great deal of time on that later in this course.","The one other thing that we need for Expectimax is the expecti- part.","That's expectations.","And the expected value of a function of a random variable is just an","average, and it's a weighted average where the outcomes, function values,","are all weighted by whatever the probability distribution says.","So for example, if we wanted to know how long it would take to get to the","airport, that's going to be a function of the traffic.","And so what I would do is I'd say, all right, it's going to","depend on the traffic.","And here the three values and their probabilities.","For each of those values, there's some associated function value-- in this","case, the time.","And then to compute the expectation, I just multiply each probability times","function value, add them up, and I end up with my expected value.","That's exactly what we've been doing at these chance nodes.","They're simply expectations of the children's values--","Expectimax values--","weighted by the probabilities.","OK.","So great.","What probabilities should we use?","Well, in an Expectimax search, these chance nodes reflect what we think the","relative chances are of the various outcomes.","Sometimes that's easy.","For example, sometimes I'm going to roll a die, and I know that each of","the six outcomes on a six-sided die are equally likely, and then I can","just use even weights.","But sometimes it can be very sophisticated.","For example, if I'm trying to figure out what a ghost is doing, I might","observe the ghost, I might take some notes, I might take the temperature of","the air, and then I might do some computation and say, under these","circumstances, I think the chance that the ghost will go left is 30%.","We'll get to how to do that later, but for now, realize that these","probabilities can require a lot of work to compute.","Every single outcome that's out of our control, whether it's an opponent our","an environment, has a chance node in the Expectimax tree.","The probabilities reflect our belief as to what will happen.","There's nothing to say that our belief, and therefore those","probabilities, shouldn't put a lot of probability on the adversarial action.","And we'll talk about this relationship a little later.","One important thing to remember is that just because we assign","probabilities that reflect our beliefs as to the outcome does not mean that","the thing on the other side is flipping coins.","If I think there is a 20% chance that the ghost is going to go to the left,","it doesn't mean that the ghost has a random number generator.","It just means that given my model, which may be a simplification, that's","the best I can say, given my evidence.","So where do the probabilities come from?","Well, for today, they come from the probability fairy.","We think for today that the definition of the problem includes the","probabilities.","Later in the course, we'll have to figure out ways to really compute them","in a given context.",""]}
