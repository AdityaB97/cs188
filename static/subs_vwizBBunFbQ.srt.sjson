Another big sub-area of artificial intelligence is perceiving the world,","and in large part this is vision but there's other kinds of perception.","So, things like object recognition, face recognition.","You probably have a lot of this technology closer than you think, you","probably have face recognition built into your cameras, that's actually face detection,","not always face recognition though some cameras do that too. Segmenting scenes into pieces,","figuring out for a given image what it means, what's going on.","Here's an example on the left of an image, and overlaid on the image is the","machine's reconstruction of kind of the underlying 3D","outline and mesh,","and you can see that reconstructed on the right. This is from an image, but actually","it turns out that in addition to being able to do a bunch of cool things in","vision with the image,","one realization we've had in cases like autonomous driving and vision is","we don't have to use the tools that humans use. We've spent a long time with vision","just trying to use like a camera, or maybe two cameras slightly apart because","that's what we have, we've got two cameras slightly apart. But then we realized,","we can do other stuff. So what's this, anybody recognize this?","It's a Kinect. The Kinect's got sensors that you don't.","Sorry you didn't get a rangefinder, a depth detector, you just didn't.","But, you know, we can build them so why not. And so, now we can do cool things like","take an image and produce a depth map that isn't just about parallax, looking at","the distance between the two eyes, or about kind of inferring from occlusion.","You'll notice, people like to think that vision is all about having two images,","but if you close one eye, you can still see depth.","It's not like the world suddenly goes flat and you shriek. I mean, you close one eye, you still have a sense of depth,","we want to be to build machines that do that, but at the moment we do pretty well by","using things like depth detectors, cause why not.","Let's take a look at science fiction again.","Does anybody recognize this movie? Does anybody know what this is gonna be?","Yeah, this is Terminator here, and let's take a look at what it's like to be a","Terminator--it's relevant to vision. So here's what it's like to be a terminator.","It's actually a lot like being Governor of California, apparently.","Okay, so he looks around,","okay, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, car,","motorcycle,","some place, target acquired. Okay, so","looking around, outlines, detection. Identifying what the objects are, figuring","out what the target is, that's from the movies.","Straight out of science fiction.","Let's look at some vision recognition system--this is a cute demo from Al Rahimi's lab.","","So here we have a camera panning around, and it's kind of--we can do exactly the same","thing but for real. So here we have","the cat.","Cat...","Frog...","Fox...","Dalmatian...","Bulldog... Terminate bulldog, right. Okay.","So,","this is a case where I think it's amazing how close we can get to what people thought","it might be like if this technology were possible. This is not robots from the","future detecting the bulldog, this is today."]}
