And S to A has backward cost 1, forward cost 6, total cost 7.","We have S to G, which looks like it has backward cost 5, forward cost 0,","total cost 5.","All right, so what comes off?","S to G comes off.","We see it passes the goal test and we return it.","Optimal cost 5.","Oops, right.","So the problem here is, we actually got the wrong answer out of A*.","Why didn't we keep traveling down the S to A path that was","going to turn out well.","It was going to be so cheap, 1 plus 3.","Why'd we stop?","We stopped because of this guy.","The heuristic says, abandon all hope, ye who enter here, and we say, OK, you","can stay on the fringe now.","We're going to go do something else.","And so the problem is, this heuristic, it's nice because it can push you","towards the goal, but it's dangerous because if it tells you this is really","bad news, well, you won't explore that area of the graph.","So what went wrong here is the actual bad goal cost here was less than the","estimated good goal cost.","And in particular, this number 6 overestimated the expense, and silly","us, we listened to the heuristic.","So we need our estimates.","Our heuristic values, they need to always be less than the actual cost.","So if it actually costs us 3 to get to the goal, the heuristic, it can answer","0, it can answer 3, but it better not say 6, or we're going to start being","so optimal.","","PROFESSOR: So this is a key idea for getting A star search to be correct.","It's the idea of admissibility.","And this has to do with whether you're, it's kind of your heuristics","outlook on life.","If your outlook is bad, if you have a heuristic which is pessimistic, we","call it inadmissible.","And an inadmissible heuristic is one that always says you're farther than","the goal than you are, or maybe there's some good path that says, oh,","that's terrible.","It's going to cost a million, right?","We saw that if the heuristic lies to you and says that something costs more","than it actually does, we can make mistakes.","So here's a case where pessimistic inadmissible heuristics, they break","optimality.","An admissible, or optimistic heuristic is one that always underestimates the","true costs, but hopefully not by too much.","And these heuristics can slow down a bad path.","They can say yeah, this path is expensive.","I'm not sure how expensive.","Not more than this, but it is going to be pretty expensive.","And when it tells you it's going to cost at least eight, you believe it,","and you're safe in believing it, right?","And so an admissible heuristic and slow down the bad plans on the fringe.","It can keep them on the fringe for longer, so you don't have to explore","what they lead to.","But in the end, the heuristic never outweighs your true costs.","And that means the cheap stuff will eventually win.","And so you'll eventually do the right thing.","In math, a heuristic h is admissible, or optimistic if","it's less than h star.","And h star is defined to be the true optimal cost to a nearest goal.","So of course we build heuristic h.","They're little snippets of code that execute them in compute h of n.","We don't know how to build h star of n, right?","But it's a mathematical thing.","And so what you would do is you would prove that the h that you have built","is less than h star, which you can't build.","And then you know you're safe.","So here's some examples of admissible heuristics.","We already saw one.","So on this kind of Pac-Man board, the Manhattan distance.","Change in x plus change in y is admissible because if there are no","walls, you could get there that fast.","But chances are the walls will make you take some detours.","It's admissible in that it's less than the true cost.","It may be a lot less than the true cost, depending on how","tricky the maze is.","Here's pancake flipping.","I said I have to at least flip in order to get, if the fourth pancake is","out of position, in order to get it in position, I have to at least do a flip","of size four.","But I might have to do a lot of other flips.","So here's a case where it's admissible because it kind of keeps track of one","part of the solution.","But there may be a lot cell so the solution that's going to cause you to","incur costs as well.","In practice, it's easy to define what admissibility is.","Coming up with admissible heuristics, which are lower bounds like this, but","are still accurate enough to be useful in search is a big part of what's","involved in using A star in practice.","So people already know the A star algorithm.","You're not going to publish a paper on the A star algorithm very easily.","However, if you have a task that has an interesting heuristic, that takes a","lot of work to figure out how A star works in my case, because A star is","not a problem specific, but your heuristic is."]}
