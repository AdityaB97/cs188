another example.","This is cryptarithmetic.","How many of you have solved a cryptarithmetic problem?","OK.","Very important for things such as robotic crime fighting.","In a cryptarithmetic problem, the variables are the letters in the","arithmetic problem, and each letter stands for a number.","So here, the variables are things like the F, the T, and so on.","There's some extra variables you need to insert--","X1, X2, X3 for the carry bits.","When you actually solve this, you need to keep track of whether or not you","carried a one.","Each of these variables has a single digit domain, so 0 to 9.","And the constraints indicate, well, when you substitute something in for O","and something in for R, then O plus O has to equal R, and so on.","And so if we wrote this out, we would write things like, well, they all have","to be different, and O plus O equals R, and we would connect in the carry","bit and so on.","We're not going to go through the details of cryptarithmetic, but the","point here is, these constraints aren't that complicated to phrase, but","they actually touch more than two variables at once.","And so what we can do is we can draw the constraint graph here, but we'll","find out that an arc doesn't suffice.","So for example, for this constraint here, this one touches O, R, and X1,","and that's this constraint right here.","And when we have constraint graphs that contain constraints that are more","them binary, meaning they touch more than two variables, we draw them as a","square to indicate the constraints, and we connect that square up to all","of the variables that are constrained.","Here's another example.","Sudoku.","How many people have played Sudoku?","OK.","So, here's an example of Sudoku.","The variables here, every open square takes on some value.","So it's going to be a variable.","The domains are going to be one through nine.","That's how Sudoku works.","And there are constraints.","What do the constraints look like?","Well, every column has to have nine different values, and every row has to","have nine different values.","Every three by three square as shown has to have nine different values in","that region.","And we could just encode these all different things as a bunch of","pairwise inequality constraints, that would be fine too.","But you get the idea of how a Sudoku board can be phrase as an","instance of a CSP.","OK, we've seen a bunch of examples of CSPs so far that look very much like","puzzles, kind of configurational things.","Here's an example of a CSP that does something very, very different.","So this is the Waltz Algorithm.","The Waltz Algorithm was originally designed for interpreting line","drawings of solid polyhedra in three dimensions.","So for example, you would have some robot looking at some scene, and it","would see some line drawing that it got out of a vision system, and it's","trying to figure out what the heck is this thing.","Is it concave?","Is it convex?","Is it what kind of structure?","You can think of this, I mean, unless you've got Escher drawing your","structures here, that when you look at these, you'd see, OK, that vertex","there is an outie, right?","It's pointing out at you.","And this one here, this one's in innie.","But they kind of both look the same locally.","They both have three lines coming together.","And in order to be able to look at a drawing like this and figure out which","of the corners are innies and which of them are outies, the Waltz Algorithm","was developed.","This is an early example of a computation that you'd want to do","posed as a declarative constraint satisfaction problem.","So what's the approach?","The approach is that each intersection is a variable.","So for example, you'd have a variable here.","You'd have another variable here.","And adjacent intersections impose constraints on each other.","Like, if the top one is an outie, the bottom one can't be an innie in this","particular case, in a certain way.","If you then solved the CSP, all of the physically realizable 3D","interpretations show up as solutions of the constraint","satisfaction problem.","So here's a neat case where kind of we've encoded a geometric","interpretation problem as a CSP.","Same machinery to solve as the rest of them.",""]}
