Siri may not be the best at telling bedtime stories","but Siri does some amazing things, and the pieces that make that up are","actually used in many places in industry. There's automatic speech recognition,","where you go from speech to text. There's text-to-speech synthesis which","is an easier problem where you go from the text to the speech. And then there's dialogue systems","that integrate all this together, linguistic analysis.","Let me show you what a","speech recognition system looks like","just kind of when you point it at the TV. So this is not customized to a","specific speaker, this is not over some great microphone like how your phones","have really sophisticated microphones these days.","This is just plugged straight into the TV as essentially automatic transcription. Let's see","how well it does, and in particular watch the errors.","","","","","","So, what's interesting about this. First of all,","is it good? Is it bad?","It does a lot of stuff.","It does a lot of things right. It makes some mistakes.","The mistakes are of multiple kinds, so for example, here","\"The classmates said their final goodbyes\".","That's like good buys like Best Buy. right. That is exactly the sounds that","the reporter said.","The failing here in this case was not in the acoustic modeling which tries to","connect","the wave forms to the underlying linguistic sounds.","Here the failing is there multiple things that sound the same.","You gotta figure which one the reporter could possibly mean in the context.","This is a sad story right. Somebody died, people are not going shopping, right, and","we know this is humans, but the system does not and so in this case this","isn't a problem the language model. there are other cases here where the problem is","more in the acoustics and putting all the stuff together in some probabilistic framework","that lets you reconcile it all,","that's a big part of how speech recognition works.","We'll have more discussion on that later.","We can do more with language than just manipulate the signal from speech to text.","This is actually my research area. We can do things like question answering.","We talked a little about Watson and we'll have a lot more","later in the course about Watson.","So Watson is basically a question answering system.","Like, yeah, there's this layer of remembering to phrase it as a question 'cause","you're on Jeopardy and making sure you wager the right amount on the","Daily Double and that kinda stuff but to a first approximation a question comes in,","Watson kind of has to","dig through a lot of information like you know largely Wikipedia","and connect up some answer to the question,","so that you know how to respond. Basically a question answering system,","although an amazingly cool demonstration of a very good one.","Another thing we can do is machine translation. How many of you have used","a tool like Google translate?","So, you know, again, C-3PO. How good is machine translation?","Well, depends on the language pair. I mean, if I'm looking at a page, say in Chinese,","and I don't speak any Chinese, the machine translation's pretty good because I was kind","of starting with nothing. But if I actually speak the language maybe","I'm better off reading reading it in its natural form. You can see some of these problems if","you do round trip from say, English to Chinese and back, and you can see how","good what comes back--actually that's a good way to make an unintentionally funny story.","","What else can we do: things like web search, really are about a lot of things.","It has something to do with the words but also kind of click stream information,","","and kind of a local search and things like that. And so there's a lot that goes into","web search. A big part of that is the language.","Text classification, spam filtering. Again, spam filtering is a case where it's","part language, part not language. We'll talk more about spam filtering later","--and so on. These are the kinds of things you can do in the domain of natural language.","We're no longer trying so hard to tell stories funny or otherwise.","We're trying to build things like this.","And there has been a lot of traction. There's a lot of stuff we can build.","We're not yet to C-3PO, but","we actually can now translate Russian,","which we couldn't do in the fifties even though they thought would be able to do","it by the sixties. But now, today, we can.","It only took","something like twelve times longer than they thought it would."]}
