KLEIN: So let's think about adversarial games and how we're going","to formalize this idea of a search problem, where you're not the only","person acting in the environment.","There are a lot of different kinds of games.","So, in particular, the kinds of techniques we're going to talk about","today are going to apply to a very specific class of games.","You'll notice when I did an overview of game technology, I was talking","about a very narrow class of games.","I didn't talk about poker.","That's a game of imperfect information.","We're not going to talk about that today.","I didn't talk about things like Star Craft, which is another example of","imperfect information.","I didn't talk about anything stochastic.","Poker also has a stochastic element to it.","And I didn't talk about cases where there are multiple players beyond two.","So what are we going to talk about today?","Well, it's going to be zero-sum games, and they're going to be deterministic","games, and they're going to be games of perfect information.","What we want is we want an algorithm, which allows us to calculate a","strategy which tells us what to do in each state.","Now think about how this is different from Search.","In Search, I gave you the search problem, and what you gave me back was","a plan or a path.","It was a sequence of actions that executed and it was","guaranteed to succeed.","That's not going to work here, because we don't control our opponent.","So we can't just give a plan that's guaranteed to succeed.","What we need to do is we need to give a function which tells us in any given","say what to do.","That's this policy.","In the game case, it's often called a strategy.","So we can formalize games.","If we wanted to formalize this, we could do it in multiple ways.","There's less consensus on exactly what the formalization is and what notation","to use, but you would have a set of states just like in a search case.","Now there are multiple players and they typically take turns in the way","we formalize these games.","There's a set of actions and maybe different players","have different actions.","And then the analogy to a successor function is something we can call a","transition function, though today we're actually going to continue","calling a successor function, because it won't be ambiguous today.","And what this does is this tells us how the state evolves in response to","the various actions.","There's a terminal test which tells us when the game is over.","So it's kind of like the goal past fr a search, and now there","are terminal utilities.","This tells us for an end state, how much of this is worth","to each of the players.","OK.","The solution to a game like this is a policy which maps states to actions.","","As I said before, we're going to be interested in zero-sum games.","You've probably heard that term.","What does that mean?","In a zero-sum game, like what's shown on the left, we do","have adversarial agents.","So in this case, we're going to imagine we have two agents, except","they have opposite utilities.","So when we think about a terminal state, if one likes it,","the other hates it.","Because they have opposite values on the outcomes, we don't have to think","about the blue players utility and the red players utility.","There's just one function, except the blue player wants to maximize it and","the red player wants to minimize it","And this is a really nice thing that we can think about there being a","single function.","Because this lets us reason about the extreme case of pure competition and","adversarial search.","But what about in general.","In general, this won't be true.","In general, when you have multiple agents acting, you don't imagine that","they're purely adversarial.","They simply have their own utility functions which sometimes align and","sometimes don't.","So, for example, if you imagine you have these two agents.","And they're picking out their own colors from the gem file, well, they","both be happy.","And in fact, one making progress actually helps the other by getting","rid of some of the things it doesn't care about.","So the case of a general game, the agents are going to have utilities","that are going to be independent.","They can both like an outcome.","They come both hate the outcome.","Or they could also have opposite preferences just like","the zero-sum case.","Because of this general flexibility, you can have cooperation.","You could have indifference, and you could have competition, between the","agents, and also subtle combinations of these things.","All of these things are possible in the general case.","And in fact, will fall out of computational reasoning","in the general case.","We're going to talk about non-zero-sum games later.","Today we're going to talk about pure competition.","So there's one function.","One agent maximizes it.","The other minimizes.",""]}
