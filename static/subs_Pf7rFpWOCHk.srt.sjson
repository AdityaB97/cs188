So what about utilities in humans?","We say there is a utility function that can capture all of your rich and","nuanced preferences.","What is that utility function?","How would I get it?","How would I figure out that the value you associate with Thai food is 3.7?","First, we need a utility scale.","Often people work with what are called normalized utilities, where the best","you can get is 1 and the worst you can get a zero.","But there's a lot of scales people use that are adjusted for both reasoning","about certain scenarios and also for elicitation in those scenarios.","So for example, a lot of these utility scales are actually kind of morbid,","because a lot of the times, by the time you're dredging up numerical","computations of utilities with humans, you're actually talking about very,","very difficult decisions that are hard because there are very serious","consequences.","So for example, there's the micromort.","The micromort is a one-millionth chance of death.","I told you this would be morbid.","Why is this useful?","This is useful because you have to reason about things like, should we","recall a product?","And you want to think about, what are the risks and what are the rewards in","each scenario and what are the probabilities?","You need to put these things on a scale.","And when you're talking about things like product safety, often you really","are talking about chance of death.","And so that's your utility scale.","It's not the only one.","A lot of the others are also morbid but important.","So for example, medical reasoning is often done in","quality-adjusted life years.","Unlike a product risk where the danger is somebody is going to die and you're","looking aggregate safety, now you're looking at an individual person and","trying to think about balancing the fact both that a medical procedure","might change the duration of your life and also the quality.","And so you try to put your utility function in a setting where this is","captured in as transparent a way as possible.","The reason why we can have these different scales is that behavior is","going to be invariant under any positive linear transformation.","Of course, if you invert the sine of the utilities, the","behavior is going to change.","And we saw earlier that if you square them, the behavior will change.","But positive linear transformations are safe.","If all you had when you tried to figure out people's utilities was","prize choices, if I just went to you and say, do you like chocolate or","strawberry, then I can get a certain degree down the road.","I could figure out enough, for example, to do minimax.","But if I actually want to figure out your rich and nuanced preferences, I","need to ask you questions about lotteries.","So how do we actually figure out what these numbers are that encode a","human's utility?","It's really, really hard.","So the standard approach to assessing utility--","it's often called eliciting utilities--","looks something like this.","You take your human and you ask them questions about various things.","And they get to describe their preferences.","Remember, that's fundamental.","You elicit preferences and then you can figure out what the utilities are","that encode those preferences.","So what you do is you compare some prize whose utility you care about to","a standard lottery which is between something really good and something","really bad.","And you slide the probability until the human becomes indifferent.","Wherever that probability lands gives you a way of figuring out what the","utility is.","For example, paying $30.","Do you want to pay $30?","Probably not.","OK.","So what exactly is the utility we should associate with","this mildly bad thing?","Well, what I do is I pull out a lottery.","So I say, all right, let's figure out just exactly how much you don't want","to pay $30.","Well, you're going to have a lottery between no change--","we're just kidding, you don't have to pay the $30.","That's better than paying $30.","On the other hand, you have instant death.","That's worse than paying $30.","And so what we do is we fiddle with the probabilities.","And once we find that magic probability that tells you that you're","indifferent, well, now we have some sense of how bad this $30 payment is.","You know, for most people it's small.","It's a micromort.","If pay $30 was really bad, it was pay $3 million, be in debt for the rest of","your life, you'd probably get slightly different numbers.","And that reflects the fact that the utilities of things are going to","depend not just on the prizes in the lottery, but the probabilities with","which you mix them.","How about money?","As soon as we talk about utilities, people think, OK, well, let's encode","everything in dollars.","Money, it turns out, does not behave as a utility function.","But of course, we can talk about the utility of having money.","In fact, we just did.","So how do we think about money in the context of utility?","Money certainly has utility.","But it's not a good utility scale.","Why not?","How do we think about these things?","Let's imagine a lottery.","This lottery, you're either going to get X dollars or Y dollars.","And you get X dollars with probability p, and Y dollars with the remaining","probability.","So this is some lottery.","Obviously, how good this thing is depends on X, Y, and p.","Its expected monetary value is simply the average of the dollar amounts.","I haven't said anything about utilities here.","I'm just saying there are two dollar amounts, a probability, and I can","compute the average monetary value here.","This lottery also has a utility.","And we know, because of how utility functions work, its utility isn't the","average of the utility of X dollars and the utility of Y dollars.","It is typically the case, though not always, that the utility of a lottery","over money is worth less than the utility of its","expected monetary value.","In this sense, people are basically risk-averse when it comes to money.","That's what this means.","You'd rather have the smaller value of a sure thing than the lottery that has","a higher expected monetary value.","And when people are in debt, they tend to be risk-prone.","Why?","You might think, OK, well, wait.","But some people are more risk-averse than others.","That's certainly true.","But let's think about it.","What does this graph look like?","You've got money here.","So this is the amount of dollars.","And you've got utility here.","So this is the amount of utility.","Let's say this is zero dollars.","Well, how many of you would like a million dollars?","A million dollars is good.","It's a little weird that you didn't all raise your hands.","But a million dollars is pretty good.","It would make a pretty big change in the quality of most people's lives,","big gain in utility.","Would you like a billion dollars?","Yes.","You would like that more than a million dollars, please.","Let's say I gave you a billion dollars.","Now how much do you want a million dollars?","Oh, whatever.","A million dollars on top of a billion is not so important.","And that means there's diminishing returns.","So in terms of your utility, it looks something like this.","At the beginning, wherever you are, adding money is good.","Presumably more money stays better for a typical person.","But it has to level off.","I'm told that after your first trillion dollars, the second trillion","is of limited utility.","Now what happens when it's negative?","Well, it's kind of got to look the same in the limit.","Things can only get so bad.","Once you're a billion dollars in debt, you know, whatever, right?","I mean, presumably at some point you're too big to fail.","Anyway--","But like it's not exactly symmetric.","It tends to stay this way and then slowly change.","But it's going to eventually have to level off.","So let me replace that with an actual graph from actual data elicited from","actual people.","It looks something like this.","It does level off positive.","It eventually turns risk-prone negative, but not immediately.","It's not completely symmetric, because zero isn't particularly","well-defined here.","This is the general behavior of money and utility interacting.","Because of these kinds of effects with money, there's a whole industry of","things like insurance.","So let's think about a specific money lottery.","Let's say you have a lottery of having a 50/50 chance of either $1,000 or","zero dollars.","This could be, for example, you have a $1,000 computer and there's a 50%","chance it's going to get stolen, which would leave you with zero computer.","So you have this lottery.","So lucky you.","What's the expected monetary value of this lottery.","It's $500.","You just average the dollar amounts.","This lottery that you are currently holding, your easily-stolen computer,","has expected monetary value of $500.","What is its certainty equivalent?","What's a certainty equivalent?","That is the amount of money that would be acceptable to you in","place of this lottery.","How much money would you trade this mixture of $1,000 and zero for?","Who would trade this lottery for $10?","No one.","Who would trade this lottery for $900?","Everyone.","All right.","Who would trade this lottery for $400?","OK.","Most people.","Well, in fact, for most people $400 is about the certainty equivalent for","this lottery.","It's lower than the expected monetary value.","But it's not ridiculously lower.","The difference here, that $100 between the certainty equivalent that you","would accept in place of the lottery and the actual average monetary value","of this lottery, that's called the insurance premium.","And the reason there's an insurance industry is because people are willing","to pay to reduce their risk.","If everyone were completely risk-neutral in this sense, we","wouldn't need any insurance.","Now maybe this is one of these things where it's just a scam.","You really shouldn't sign up for insurance, because really it's just","exploiting your human imperfection.","Not true.","It's win-win.","The reason why this insurance can be win-win, at least if the numbers work","out the right way, is because you would actually rather have the $400","than this lottery.","So in doing this trade, you win.","You're happy.","The insurance company would rather have the lottery than the $400.","Why?","Well, their utility curve is much flatter, because they're zoomed in.","$10 is nothing to them.","They're zoomed in.","When you zoom in on anything, it gets pretty flat.","It gets pretty linear.","Also, remember that the insurance company has a lot of lotteries.","So essentially they benefit from the central limit theorem.","You don't.","So everybody wins.","You win.","They win.","It's all happy, if the numbers work out to reflect everybody's utilities.","That's not to say that humans are perfectly rational.","There are a lot of cases where people have tried to show that people are","rational where people are not rational.","And they try to do it with actual experiments asking people about","questions about their preferences.","So let's do this experiment.","It's a classic experiment.","Here are two lotteries.","Lottery A, you have an 80% chance of $4,000 or nothing.","And Lottery B, you have a 100% chance of $3,000 and zero","percent chance of nothing.","Who prefers Lottery A?","Who prefers Lottery B?","OK.","Overwhelming preference for Lottery B. So Lottery B, overwhelming preference.","Well, that doesn't seem unreasonable.","Let's give you some more lotteries.","Here's C versus D. In C, you have a 20% chance of $4,000.","And in D, you have a 25% chance of $3,000.","Who prefers Lottery C?","Lots of people.","Who prefers Lottery D?","A couple people.","We're going to call C the winner.","It turns out that's pretty typical.","Most people like B than A. And most people like C better than D. What's","the problem?","Well, I can't tell you what the utility of a certain dollar amount is.","But I could assume that zero is zero.","That's just shifting the scale.","And then assuming that more money is better here, if B is greater than A,","that means that the utility for $3k is greater than 0.8 times","the utility for $4k.","And that's fine.","Except if C is better than D, I can look at those same numbers and just","multiply C and D by four and get the opposite conclusion.","0.8 times the utility of $4k, whatever it is, has to be greater than the","utility of $3k.","So what the heck?","You're in a class that I said could be entitled \"Computational Rationality\"","and here you are, irrational preferences.","Are you irrational?","Or did I do something wrong?","Of course you think I did something wrong.","What did I do wrong, because of course you're rational, right?","What's going on is there's some subtlety in how this is phrased.","There's actually a lot going on here.","You could have a very long and very detailed conversation about how human","utilities actually work.","One important thing that's happening here is in A, here, I didn't tell you","about the zero.","But the zero is actually very different.","Here, the zero doesn't really matter.","Here, you have a 20% chance of getting zero and you receive something else if","you end up with zero under Lottery A. What do you receive?","You receive the feeling of stupidity.","Nobody likes to feel stupid.","And that's part of one explanation of why you can look at these outcomes and","say that the model is oversimplified.",""]}
