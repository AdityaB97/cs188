KLEIN: OK, so today we're going to talk about Adversarial Search, which","is how to decide how to act when there is an adversary in your world.","So let's take a quick overview of what the state of the","art is in game playing.","So here's one case, checkers.","In 1950, there was the first computer player of checkers.","Kind of amazing, we actually saw this earlier in the first lecture.","In 1950, there were already having computers playing checkers.","They weren't actually that good.","In 1994, we had the first computer champion, the computer program Chinook","ended the 40-year reign of the human champion, Marion Tinsley.","Basically Marion Tinsley was the world champion in","checkers for kind of forever.","No one else was anywhere near as good, until there was Chinook","who dethroned him.","This was using the kinds of techniques we're going to talk about today, plus","an exhaustive end game database for kind of the last eight","pieces of the game.","In 2007, checkers was entirely solved.","And we'll talk today about what that means.","So checkers--","you can't actually get any better than solving the game.","So we're doing great.","How about chess?","The big event chess was in 1997 when Deep Blue defeated human","champion Gary Kasparov.","This was this amazing historic event where Deep Blue was examining many,","many positions using custom hardware, custom evaluation functions, and then","some methods that we don't entirely know everything about that allowed it","to search much deeper into the tree.","And we'll see today why that's an important thing to be able to do.","So in chess, how are we doing?","Well, I'd say we're better than human experts at this point.","Have about Go?","So Go is a really hard game for computers.","The reason why it's so hard is the branching factor is immense.","It can be greater than 300.","So there was a very long time where even though computers were dominating","at chess, and humans were afraid to play them, humans were unwilling to","play them at Go, because it was kind of insulting to the human.","Here's this computer, as far as you can tell it's moving randomly and you","just crush it.","That's changed.","Very recently, there have been huge advances in Go that use Monte Carlo","which basically means randomized methods to expand much further into","the tree and be able to handle the fact that in Go sometimes you need to","really, really look forward very far to see the eventual consequence of","your action in a way that humans are very good but brute force multiply","search is very bad at.","So in Go, the best humans are still better, but we're","making amazing progress.","So the real question on all your minds is what about Pac-Man?","Well, we don't really know, but we'll see if we can make some progress on","that in this lecture.","So what's this all about?","Really, a general point in this course is that what we'd like to be able to","do is take the definition of something-- a search problem, a game--","and be able to build a system which exhibits intelligent behavior, where","that behavior comes not from hard coding the behavior itself but from","some computation that's a general purpose computation that can give rise","to very adaptive behavior that does the right thing in","many possible scenarios.","So let's take a look at an example of this.","We're going to see the mystery Pac-Man.","So I'll run this in a second.","And what I want you to think while I run this is what kinds of computations","must be happening inside this Pac-Man playing agent in order to give rise to","the variety of behaviors that you see.","","OK, so pretty good.","Question is how do we do that kind of thing?","We'll talk about how to do that kind of thing today.","And the important thing is we want to at all costs avoid doing things like","programming \"if you're within three squares of a power pellet, eat the","power pellet.","If there is a scared ghost and the scared ghost is within 10, then go","with the scared ghost.\"","Because things like that end up being very fragile, and they'll do the wrong","thing when there's a scared ghost and a power pellet and","two nonscared ghosts.","And we want some general purpose computation.","And that's the topic for today.",""]}
