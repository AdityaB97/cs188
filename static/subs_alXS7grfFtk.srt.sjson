We talked about theorem proving,","can we prove mathematical theorems. That stuff is happening too and it's also important.","So, on the logic front for example we can build amazing theorem provers","compared to when people started doing this. These provers are used for","more than just proving theorems. For example, NASA uses these for fault diagnosis.","There are some question answering systems which are no longer","purely logical, but there is a component of logical theorem proving. You try to","prove that the statement","that you think answers the question actually entails the question in the appropriate way.","","That's the way that logic and theorem proving has made its way into very different","domains like natural language processing. The methods people use are things like","deduction systems. The closest we'll get to this in this class is constraint satisfaction,","but you'll get a flavor for how this stuff works.","Also it's worth pointing out that satisfiability solvers have had","huge advances in the past decade and are now able to do really amazing things.","What's shown here on the right is a proof of something called the Robbin's conjecture.","You probably","haven't heard the Robbin's conjecture itself, but it was an open algebraic question,","and there is a short, human interpretable proof","that a theorem prover chugged out that humans have been looking for for a while. This is a case of","you see it, and you're like, yeah, that's right.","That's a case of an open question being proved by a computer in the way","humans would prove it, in the sense that the human can interpret the proof.","There's also theorem proving by computers where the computer does a brute force,","but the human doesn't want to check 4.7 billion cases, but the computer does,","and so the computer does it."]}
