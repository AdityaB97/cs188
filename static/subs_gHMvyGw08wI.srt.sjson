Right.","Here's an arc.","At some point in this algorithm, I looked at it, and I made it consistent","by deleting things from B. So there was a point at which it was","consistent.","And the question is, could my further processing mess that up.","Well what I do after this.","I changed, possibly, something about the arc from B to C and from A","to B, and so on.","But basically, all of the arcs I touch after this one are on the left.","Which means all of the domains that I could possibly delete values from are","on the left.","And when do I have to revisit this arc to make it consistent again.","What domain is important.","The head, so as long as D here doesn't lose a value from its domain, this","arc, once consistent, will stay that way.","And because nothing in this algorithm will then delete a value","from D, we're good.","So once I've done this single pass, all of these arcs in this direction a","consistent.","Not the other direction, but I don't care about the other direction for","this algorithm.","All right.","So now we know that after this pass, all of the arcs in this direction are","consistent.","The second claim is, if all of the route-to-leaf arcs, these directions,","are consistent, then forward assignment will not backtrack.","And we've already basically seen why that's true.","Right.","And we can do an induction on position.","So at the beginning you're fine.","You assign something to A, and whatever you assign to A, because A to","B is consistent, you can extend to B. What's the important bit.","The important bit here is that, for example, when I get to, let's say, E--","and if I'm thinking about making an assignment at E --if D-to-E is","consistent, and I've assigned something to D, I'm guaranteed there's","a value at E which will continue to satisfy the constraints.","So that's great but why don't I have an algorithm that works for any CSP.","Where in this do we actually use the fact that this is a tree.","Well, an important place we used it, is what if E had another parent.","What if there were an arc from C-to-E. And so the arc from D-to-E, let's say","it were consistent, and the arc from C-to-E is also consistent.","And I say great.","I have a value at D, which means I can extend it to an assignment at E. I","have a value at C, and that means I can extend it to an assignment at E.","Why isn't that enough.","Problem is, the value that is safe that E, based on what I did at D, and","the value that's safe at E based on what I did at C may","not be the same value.","Arc consistency doesn't let you have two things happening at once, be safe","at the same time.","That would be some higher order of consistency.","So for tree-structured CSPs, arc consistency--","in fact we're not even enforcing full arc consistency --is enough to","guarantee that you won't backtrack.","But once you have cycles, all bets are off.","The basic idea where a tree structure ensures that the steps that you take","kind of don't reenter and interact again in a bad way, we have that here","in CSP's, and we'll see it again later for Baye's nets.",""]}
