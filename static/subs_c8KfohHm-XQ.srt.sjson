here's back to the case of Romania.","We're trying to get from Arad to Bucharest.","And we're going to think about what the search tree looks like and what an","algorithm for on-the-fly discovery of plans might look like.","And that's going to lead us to the general search algorithm.","So here's a search tree.","When you start off, you've only got the top of the tree.","You've got to start state.","Now in principle, there's all this green stuff that's","mathematically defined.","There is a rest of the tree.","But unless you've done something wrong you haven't constructed this dotted","green stuff in code yet.","So how's search going to work?","Well we're going to start at the very top and we're going to build downward","in some way.","As we go, we're going to maintain a collection of potential plans, which","are nodes in this tree, and that collection is going","to be called a fringe.","This fringe is plans that we are still considering that may","lead us to the goal.","And again we're going to try to expand as few tree nodes as possible until we","find a goal.","So at this point, the only potential plan we've got on our fringe is the","one that says, empty plan, you're at Arad.","OK well that expands, so I might take that off the fringe.","And it turns into three longer plans--","one that gets me to Sibiu, you that gets me to","Timisoara, and one to Zerind.","Now on my fringe is these three plans.","I can't consider them all at once.","I can't extend them all simultaneously.","So I'm going to have to pick one.","I'm going to take something off.","Maybe I'll take off the one to Sibiu.","And then I expand it.","And then it has longer plans.","And now my collection of plans under consideration are these four length","two plans and the two length one plans.","They're all sitting in my fringe and I keep going.","And eventually I'm going to consider a plan and discover it achieves my goal.","And I'll be happy and declare victory and return that solution.","OK?","That's Tree Search.","So here's the algorithm in pseudo code.","We're not going to process the pseudo code in depth, but I want to show you","how it breaks down.","You'll have a chance to go through this in much greater","detail in your projects.","So what does Tree Search do?","Well you pass in a problem.","We'll get to strategy in a bit.","You pass in a problem and you do something over and over again.","What you do is you check.","And if there are no plans that you're currently considering then you can't","achieve your goal and you return failure.","You say, goal not achievable.","If there's still a set of plans that might work, you pick one.","It's a leaf node on the tree, but it's just a partial plan in your fringe.","So you pick something.","And then if that plan you just picked happens to achieve your","goal, you're done.","You have a plan for achieving your goal and you do your","goal-achieving dance.","If it doesn't, then you expand this node and all of its children--","they're all longer plans--","they all go back into the fringe.","So that's the cycle.","The important ideas are, there's a fringe which is all of the plans that","may yet work, there's expansion which is picking something out of the","fringe, and if it's not a goal already, putting in all of the","extensions of that plan, the expansions.","And there's your exploration strategy, which is all these things sitting on","the fringe.","Some of them are good ideas.","Some of them are bad ideas.","Which one should I do next?","So that's the main question.","And this is going to basically define all of the search algorithms we're","going to study.","What fringe nodes do you explore next?","So let's do an example of Tree Search.","So let's say, what does it look like?","We start off with a fringe.","So we have our fringe here.","And then we actually have our tree which we're going","to build as we process.","Really the key object in the code is the fringe.","The tree's kind of there.","It exists in back pointers, so from a node you can figure","out how you got there.","But really the fringe is the key object.","The tree is object it makes sense to think about on slides.","I'm going to draw them both in some of these cases.","So let's think, what are we going to do?","We start off with a tree which is just S. And that means on our fringe is the","empty plan, congratulations you're still at S. We have to pick one.","So there's no choice.","We pick S and we expand it.","And that means back on the fringe goes S to D, S to E, and S to P. And that's","kind of equivalent to expanding out the tree with D, E and P. And now the","fringe is these nodes.","What do I take off next?","E. All right.","So off comes E. And what are its successors?","","S to E to H. S to E to R. And this is equivalent to E having","now H and R as children.","And now my fringe is this kind of periphery of the tree.","I won't keep drawing the fringe in both places.","What do I pop next?","S to E to R. There may be multiple ways on my fringe of achieving R, at","least in the algorithms as they are right now.","So S to E to R pops off.","And then on to my fringe goes S to E to R to F. And that R right now has","this child F.","What should I pop off next?","S-E-R-F, serf.","We pop off the serf.","S-E-R-F--","","and now this has two children.","One with C-R-F, and one with G. Am I done?","Strictly speaking, you're not done.","And this will be more important for some algorithms than others.","Strictly speaking, your successors go on the fringe and only when they come","off the fringe could you possibly declare victory.","But what shall I pop off?","Next maybe we'll pop this off.","It passes the goal test.","And now we have a solution and we return it.","So without expanding the whole tree, we found a goal.","We did it relatively efficiently.","I would say this is a successful use of Tree Search to find a goal without","having to expand something large and exponential.","This algorithm is called CS188 Guided Search and is not, in general,","available to you.",""]}
