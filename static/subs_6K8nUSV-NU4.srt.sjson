KLEIN: Here's another idea.","An algorithm called simulated annealing.","The idea is that you can escape local maxima by not simply going","uphill all the time.","If you go uphill all the time, you have this problem that if you're going","uphill, and then there's a little blip, and then uphill again, you may","stop here and declare victory, right?","And if only you would take this tiny step downhill, you could just resume","what you were doing before, getting better and better.","And so what you do is you essentially bounce around.","So here's the algorithm in pseudocode, but here's the important idea about","this algorithm.","You have some current state, just like any local search algorithm.","And you're going to look at the successors, just like in any other","search algorithm.","The difference is you have this other concept of a temperature, OK?","And the idea is when the temperature is high, you're","bouncing around like crazy.","And essentially you're going to go to a neighbor, whether it's better than","you or not.","So what you do is you pick a random successor, right?","Not the best successor, a random successor.","And you figure out, is it better or worse than me?","If it's better than me, I'll take it.","If it's worse than me, maybe I'll take it.","I'll take it when the temperature is high.","And so the beginning, you're just kind of bouncing around like crazy.","And as time goes on, you change the temperature.","You lower it.","This is where the annealing comes, in it's a physics analogy.","You lower the temperature, and you take these downhill steps less and","less often.","But if you only one downhill step away from making huge progress, you'll sit","there, you'll bounce around for a while.","Eventually you'll escape and continue going.","So it's kind of uphill, but kind of a very caffeinated way of going uphill.","Simulated annealing.","Magic or not?","So here's a theoretical guarantee the sure makes it look like magic.","The guarantee says this.","It says that if you run this forever, keep in mind you will not actually run","this forever.","If you did run this forever, then you would find that you spend more time at","certain places in the search space than others.","And because of how the algorithm works, you spend more time at higher","places on the mountain.","So essentially E here is your fitness function.","If the fitness function is high, you'll spend more time up there,","because it kind of takes you longer to bounce your way out of a very high","point than a very low point.","As the temperature decreases, you tend to get stuck where you are.","So in essence, you've got this beautiful guarantee this says as T","goes to zero, then you will converge to the optimal state.","And you will spend kind of infinitely much time there.","That's great.","OK, is this interesting?","Well, it's certainly interesting.","Is it useful?","So it sounds like magic, and sometimes simulated annealing can be very","powerful for escaping mild local optima.","However, it is still the case that if you are at a local optimum, and you","need to take 30 downhill steps to get out, you kind of have to take 30","downhill steps to get out without getting distracted and going back up","to where you came from.","And typically, taking 30 downhill steps is unlikely in any problem at","any temperature.","And so really, there's this issue that if you are in a very, very kind of","extreme local optimum where you have to take many downhill steps to get","out, you're probably suck there in practice.","Yes, if you ran this forever, after a billion years you","would finally escape.","And then you would get to an even better place for which it would take","you a trillion years to escape.","So in the limit you're going to the right thing, but given that you don't","care about anything much beyond the first hour, and certainly not much you","on the first million years, that guarantee may not actually help you.","What people do in addition to this a of bouncing around a little bit is","they think about what are called ridge operators, which basically say one way","or another, if my search face looks like this, and I'm standing here, I'm","just in trouble.","And so rather than actually hoping that something like simulated","annealing will just happen to want to go downhill for a very long time,","instead what you think about is, is there a way to kind of move to a","completely different region of the space where maybe I can move","from peak to peak.","These operators are called ridge operators, because rather than kind of","going along the search problem, they add new directions.",""]}
