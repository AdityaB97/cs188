Let's think about","what our kind of popular culture has depicted artificial intelligence as","in the movies over time.","So it's possible you've seen some of these movies.","Does anybody recognize this?","Who's the tall yellow one?","That's C-3PO. What does C-3PO do?","C-3PO is the protocol droid, human-cyborg relations, right? He's","basically Google translate,","with anxiety, right?","Okay, how about R2-D2, what does he do?","Yeah, I, I have no idea what he does actually...","But the point is both of them, they're helpful,","they're well-meaning, they're good, right, and it's a very positive view on what technology can bring.","","This was the seventies.","Things kind of got darker in our popular culture view of technology,","and this goes through a wide range of genres, not just movies and so we","started worrying. Wait a minute,","maybe the robots won't translate for us and beep around,","maybe there's gonna be killer hardware from the future coming back to kill us.","It's a very different view, right, and","you know they kinda looked the same--uh, maybe not but it's a very different view of","the future. It's very scary, right. The scary hardware coming back, really with malice.","","We're now a little bit afraid of the technology.","That was the eighties. What about the nineties?

Well since then you know we've thought of a lot of ideas but","really the basic fear","of what technology might do if it goes wrong","hasn't gone away.","Now we worry about things like, what if","","kind of the evil technology turns on us and maybe actually we can't even tell","us apart from them.","Or, maybe the technology won't just look like us,","maybe instead the technology will be evil and","... really snarky.","And so we're not really sure what we're afraid of,","but kind of we know we're afraid.
