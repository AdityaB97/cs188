So what about other types of games?","I'm not going to talk about all kinds of games.","It's going to be a very long time in this course before we have the","machinery to talk about games of partial information.","But we can imagine other kinds of simple, turn-based games where the","layer types are just mixed.","For example, how about backgammon?","What happens in backgammon?","Well, I move, you move, and every time one of us moves, we roll some dice.","And so in that case, the sequence of actions is, the maximizing","agent takes an action.","There is some chance outcome, which in this case is determined by true","randomness, right?","The dice rolling that are intentionally random.","Then min goes, and then the chance node will happen again.","You can essentially, when you think about these trees, you basically just","imagine the environment is one other player in the game.","It's kind of a random agent that moves in between the min and max.","How do you compute the value of this tree?","Well, this is what's called an Expectiminimax tree.","And what you do is, each node basically does the same recursion","we've had before.","Max nodes max over their children, min nodes min over their children, and x","nodes x over their children.","The backgammon case is actually pretty interesting.","Because you're rolling dice, the branching factor explodes.","There's all these possible outcomes for the dice, and that means that even","if you only go down to depth 2, you already have a huge number of","outcomes, because not only do you have a lot of moves available to you, but","the dice kind of do their thing.","What this means is a game like this, where it's not just you and the","opponent moving, but also some element of chance with many values, it's","really hard to go very deep into the tree.","So the usefulness of a depth-based search is really, really low, because","you can't go very far into the future.","On the other hand, the probability of reaching any particular node is low.","No matter what your plan is, you can't really guarantee you're going to have","one outcome or another, because the dice are largely in control.","And that means that limiting depth is actually less damaging.","There's a historic example here, a very historic AI called TDGammon,","which used only a depth-2 search, which is actually already a lot of","computation for backgammon, and a very good evaluation function that was","tuned through reinforcement learning, which we'll talk about","later in the course.","And this achieved world champion-level play in backgammon.","This was the first AI world champion in any game.","","OK.","That's the case when there are lots of things going on, mins","and maxes and chance.","A very important general case that we haven't talked about is what happens","if the game isn't zero-sum, or there are multiple players?","And this turns out to work out as a very nice generalization of minimax.","So what's shown here is a tree with three players, red, blue, and green.","And each player is simply out to maximize their own utility.","They may compete, they may cooperate.","And what this means is we can't get away with one number and think about","having a max and a min.","Everyone's a max, but they max their own thing.","And what that means is with each state--","here the terminal states are shown--","with each state, we associate not a single utility, but we have to keep","track of how much that state is worth to each of the possible players.","So for example, if we look down here in the left, what we would do is you","would say, all right.","At this green node here, what happens?","Well, green's going to look at these two outcomes, and it's","going to say, all right.","I have a choice of something that's worth 6 to me and something that's","worth 2 to me.","What am I going to do?","I'm going to pick the one that's worth 6.","So here this state is worth 1, 6, 6 to those opponents.","Now we chose it because it was worth 6 to me, and you know,","blue's pretty happy.","We didn't set out to make blue happy.","It just kind of happened because blue and green want the same","thing at this node.","Red's unhappy.","So in some sense, our behavior actually shows that we're competing","with red, but we're not doing it, really, to make red sad.","We're doing it to make ourselves happy.","The actual numbers in the utility function suggest that we're","adversaries.","Now what's nice about this is it gives rise to coordination and cooperation","in a very sophisticated and elegant way.","And so down here on the left part of the tree, if you look at the","utilities, you see that green and blue are basically aligned, and you could","imagine that they're teaming up here.","And in fact, the actions they take will tend to support each other,","because that's what the utilities say to do when they do their reasoning.","On the other half of the tree, if you actually look down here, green and","blue have pretty opposite utilities.","So up here, they're going to have more competes.","And this notion of competing and cooperation are just extremes of the","kinds of behaviors that emerge naturally from these kinds of trees,","and that's pretty cool.","That's a case of complex behavior emerging from a very simple","computation.",""]}
