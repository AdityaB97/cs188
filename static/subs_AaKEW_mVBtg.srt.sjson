So we had depth-first search, we had breadth-first search.","They operate in very different ways, but none of them solve the problem of","what happens if the arcs in my graph have different weights.","But actually, we have all the machinery that we need.","So breadth-first search will, in a graph like this, it's that same graph,","if there are weights on these, then breadth-first search will find the","shortest path in terms of the number of actions.","So for example, it's going to find this path, which is expensive because","that short single arc in fact, weighs nine.","OK, the shortest path might be something that requires a little bit","more in terms of number of steps, but less in terms of cost.","So let's figure out what we can do with breadth-first search in order to","make it sensitive to the costs and do the right thing in terms of returning","the cheapest rather than the shallowest solution.","","PROFESSOR: And the solution is going to be something called","uniform cost search.","It's going to be more or less just like breadth-first search.","You start at the top and you work your way down.","The difference is rather than going evenly across the layers, prioritizing","them by their depth, instead we're going to prioritize","them by their cost.","So that cheap things get done first, even if they are multiple","steps into the tree.","So let's see how it works here.","So the strategy is going to be expand not a shallowest node,","but a cheapest node.","That means we need to keep track of for every node that we put on the","fringe, we need to keep track of its cost.","Now, its cost is the cumulative cost all the way from the beginning.","So the beginning, the fringe just contains the node s.","It has cost zero because we haven't done anything.","And when we pop that off, we put its successors onto the fringe.","So now the fringe contains d, e, and p with their respective costs.","OK, I won't draw the fringe at all times, but in this particular case, it","would actually look like s to d.","The costs here would be three.","S to e, the cost here would be nine.","And s to p, where the cost would be one.","Now when we look at this fringe, the thing we'll expand next is s to p","because it's cheapest, and then we'll continue on.","So in this case we'll expand s to p.","Its child goes onto the fringe.","Its child in this case happens to be expensive.","OK, what's the next cheapest thing on the fringe?","It's d, so we expand that.","And now there are various successors on the fringe.","The cheapest thing here, breadth-first search would go for e up here.","It would go for the shallow one.","But the cheapest one is actually over here. this path to b.","S to d to b.","And so we'll pop that.","And you can see that we are kind of working our way down, but we're always","doing the cheapest thing next.","So next we pop off the cost five path to e.","What's next?","The path to a.","OK, that has no children, so the next thing is the cost seven path to r.","And then the path to f.","Now, here's an interesting thing.","We found the path to g, but we don't declare victory yet.","And here it's critical that we don't.","So on the fringe is a bunch of paths, including one to g.","We don't stop, and in particular we don't even process the path to g","because it's not the cheapest.","Instead, what do we do?","We finally make our way back up here to that shallow path to e.","We process that.","Now we've processed every path in the tree up to cost nine.","What's next?","Next is the goal path.","We return it.","We declare victory.","And it actually turns out that this process will","guarantee us the cheapest.","So I said it was like breadth-first search.","What does that mean?","Well, you do all the kind of cost one things, then the cost two things, then","the cost three things.","Breath-first search did the depth one things, then the depth two things,","then the depth three things.","So the difference is although you're moving from the top to the bottom,","you're doing it in this ragged way that follows the cost contours.","At any given time, you will have expanded all paths up","to a certain cost.","And that's going to trace some jagged thing through the tree depending on","how uneven the costs are in your search problem.","What are the properties of this search?","Well, what nodes get expanded?","We already know.","First, we're going to expand everything where the cost is, say,","less than or equal to 1.","Then, eventually we'll expand everything less than or equal to 2.","Eventually, we'll expand everything with costs less than or equal to 3.","And so what do we expand?","All nodes with cost less than the cost of the cheapest solution.","OK.","All right.","Now we need some notation.","This is a little bit heavy handed.","If the solution costs C*--","so that's the cost of this thing here, this thing costs C*--","all right, how deeply could we have gone?","Well, it depends how far down in terms of steps we could go because that's","going to tell us the branching factor to what.","Well, if we can bound to the cost of an individual action, so each action","cost at least epsilon, say, 0.1, then we can look at C* divided by epsilon.","That's essentially how deep the cheapest solution could be, right?","And in the worst case, we're going to do everything in the","graph up to that step.","OK, so we could say, in the worst case, this'll take time.","It's still exponential in b.","It's now b to this effective depth, which is the cost of the solution--","so the more expensive the solution the deeper you go--","and divided by the cost of the cheapest arc.","So if the arcs are really cheap, you might have to go really deep to get an","expensive solution.","OK, so it's kind of like breadth for search, but that depth is harder to","think about.","How much space does the fringe take?","Well, just like depth first search, the fringe is kind of the periphery,","and that means it's basically the same cost.","It's still exponential.","Is this thing complete?","Basically like breadth-first search again, assuming that the best solution","has a finite cost and the minimum arc cost is positive, yes, this is","complete as well.","Now, for the kicker.","Is it optimal?","Well, I will state, but not prove, that it's optimal.","I'll prove it next lecture, because it'll be a special case of the A*","search algorithm.","So yes, this is an optimal method.","It will return not the shallowest solution like breadth-first search,","but the cheapest according to the weights.","What's it going to do?","Well remember, it explores increasing cost contours, and the good of that is","it's complete and optimal.","The bad, which we're going to have to fix next lecture, is that it explores","in every direction.","I'll show you that in the demo and we'll fix it next time.","What that means is, from the start, you consider all the things that you","could do that are cheap, whether they're making progress towards the","goal or not.","Right.","So I want to get to that door, and so I think of everything I","could do with 50 steps.","Probably that's a waste.","There's a lot of things you can do with 50 steps that don't get you","anywhere to your door, and we'll fix that."]}
