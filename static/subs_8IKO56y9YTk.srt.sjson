KLEIN: OK.","So when we decide to use Expectimax, and when we decide to use Minimax,","we're making modelling assumptions.","So we're back to this case of trying to figure out based on how we think","the world works, what computation we should do.","And in this case, there are a lot of modeling assumptions going on.","There's what are the utilities in Expectamax or Minimax.","There's what are the chance probabilities that we compute in","Expectimax.","But fundamentally, a key modeling choice is are the outcomes out of our","control adversarial or chance?","Now, it's dangerous to get it wrong.","And it's dangerous in either direction.","So in fact, optimism and pessimism can both be dangerous.","Why can optimism be dangerous?","Optimism can be dangerous because you assume that things are only happening","according to chance, when the world really is out to get you.","It's something like this.","You're wandering down, you think, oh, those bad things","aren't going to happen.","If those bad things are actually adversaries and they're after you,","you're going to do dangerous things, right?","I mean, you're basically going to get mugged a lot.","What about pessimism?","Why is pessimism dangerous?","Pessimism is dangerous because you assume the worst possible imaginable","case, even when it's extremely unlikely.","So it could be a vampire bunny.","Now, that's all nice and good at a high level.","How does this play out in terms of the actual search?","Well, we can simulate these things.","So I can take this board shown here, and I can run a simulation of Pac-Man","trying to eat that dot, and the ghost doing whatever it does.","And I can run it in lots of different ways.","I can say that is a random ghost, and I have an Expectimax Pac-Man.","And then I can run a simulation and see what happens.","So let's take a look at what happens with various combinations of actual","ghost behavior, and the modeling choice that Pac-Man makes by running","Minimax or Expectimax.","Let's start with the case of the ghost is actually random, and Pac-Man models","that correctly, meaning Expectmax search.","Well, what's going to happen?","What's going to happen is you basically go straight for the dot.","Because sure, the ghost could come for you, but you know","it's wandering around.","What are the chance it's actually going to end up on top of you?","So you go pretty much straight towards the ghost.","You take a risk, and it works out in general.","What happens when the ghost is smart, and you know it?","So you use Minimax.","Well, you're not going to go for the dot, because you know it's going to","get on top of you, and you're going to die.","And so you kind of lead it on a chase, and you do the safe thing.","And you are in a position in this board that you can force a win.","Great.","You'll notice the score was lower because I had to go","the long way around.","And that's just true.","The world is worse in a case where you have an adversary then when you don't.","So it's not surprising that the score is lower.","It doesn't mean you did something wrong.","It just means the world was worse.","What happens when you get your assumptions wrong?","Well, what happens when there's a smart ghost who's going to come right","for you, but you don't know that?","Well, you're going to take a risk, and the ghost is coming right at you, but","you just can't imagine it's true.","You keep taking these risks.","And maybe it works out, or maybe it doesn't.","That time it worked out.","What happens when the ghost is random, but you assume it's out to get you?","Right, this is vampire bunny.","Well, you're being pessimistic, so it shouldn't be too dangerous.","It's actually not particularly efficient.","So you run away, and what does the ghost do?","It just kind of does its thing.","But you're scared, right?","Because at any point, you're like any moment now, it's going to bust out its","master plan, right?","","Oh, random number generator.","","Until at some point--","no.","","All right, so we could do that a bunch of times.","I did it five times.","That's not really a statistically adequate number, but you can look at","the outcomes here.","Basically, the only thing that's actually dangerous, the only thing","that's going to get Pac-Man killed is an adversarial ghost that you assume","is not out to get you, right?","If you're overly optimistic, Pac-Man might actually die.","He gets mugged.","In the other cases, though, take a look.","Expectimax Pac-Man with a random ghost.","It's using the right model, and you get 503 because life's pretty good.","No one's out to get you.","Minimax and adversary, you still win.","You're still safe.","The score is lower, and the score is lower because the world's just worse.","What about the last case, when there's a random ghost and Minimax Pac-Man?","Well, you still win.","It just takes a while, and you saw a case where it actually","took a very long time.",""]}
