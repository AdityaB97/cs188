So the first way we're going to speed up the basic","backtracking algorithm is with an approach called filtering.","And filtering's really all about ruling out suspects.","Now of course, the backtracking search eventually tries things and finds out","whether or not they work.","Filtering is about going ahead of the backtracking search and figuring out","elements in the domains of the unassigned variables, which can safely","be eliminated.","So we'll see a couple different approaches of filtering.","The first approach is called forward checking.","And in general, whenever we're doing filtering, we're going to have to add","one new idea in addition to this idea of a partial assignment.","The unassigned variables now will have their domains exposed, and we're going","to cross off bad options as we discover them.","OK, so in forward checking, things look like this to begin with.","We don't have anything in the partial assignment, so nothing's assigned, but","all of the remaining unassigned variables have their domains shown.","What we're going to do in forward checking is every time we make an","assignment in the backtracking search, we're going to check the unassigned","variables, and if any of their values would be conflicting with our existing","assignment, we're going to cross them off.","So here's the empty one.","Let's do an assignment.","Let's say we assign red to Western Australia.","What happens?","Well, Western Australia is now going to take on its single value red, and","so what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to look and see,","are there any values in the domains of the other variables that have to go?","Well, for example, is there going to be any value in the Northern Territory","variable, NT, that has to go?","Sure.","It can't be red.","All right, so things are going to look like this after we assign red to WA.","So WA is now assigned.","NT and SA aren't assigned, but their remaining domains have shrunk.","Now what do we do?","Well, we assign something else.","We're still in a backtracking search.","Let's say we assign to Queensland, we assign it to green.","OK, so Queensland will now be assigned to green, and everything adjacent to","Queensland will have to check to see whether or not there are now values","which are unworkable.","OK, so we're going to check everything adjacent, and we're going to cross off","a bunch of greens.","We'll end up in this state.","OK, so we can see that for example, New South Wales no longer has green","because it's no longer possible to assign that without violating a","constraint against our existing assignment at Queensland.","All right, now let's look at this, for example.","What might we do next?","We might assigned here to Victoria, to V here, we might assign blue.","Well, what will happen?","Well, a bunch of things are now going to lose blue from their domain, and","we're going to end up here where South Australia actually","has no legal values.","In terms of our assignment, nothing's gone wrong.","We haven't actually violated any constraints with our assignment.","But we know that as a consequence of what we've already done, some variable","that is as yet unassigned has just had its domain go empty.","Sooner or later we're going to get to that variable, and then have to","backtrack, so we might as well backtrack now.","This is the idea of filtering, and in particular the","case of forward checking.","We cross things off as we go, and as soon as something goes empty, we know","that no solution is possible, and we can backtrack early.","So let's take a look at this in the demo.","We're going to keep our backtracking search.","We are now going to add forward checking as filtering, and you'll","notice that as soon as we switch into a filtering mode, we","have an extra notion.","Even though nothing's assigned, there are still remaining domains.","So I'm going to do an assignment, and the first assignment is going to be to","the lower left, and it's going to assign blue.","As soon as I assign blue, what's going to happen?","For these three variables here next to it, blue is going to disappear from","their domain.","So there you go.","All right, so we still only have one assignment.","We're going to move on to the next variable in the lower center.","We're going to assign the next thing, which in this case will be red.","And as soon as I do that, you can see that in the adjacent variables, red","has disappeared.","I assign again.","I assign again.","And I sign again to green here.","Now a domain has gone empty, and I'll have to backtrack.","So I'll backtrack a little bit.","","And then I solve it.","OK.",""]}
