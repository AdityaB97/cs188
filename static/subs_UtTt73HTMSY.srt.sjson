OK, so we've just found out ways to upgrade our planning agents","with heuristics.","Now we got to figure out how to do it in practice.","Not just, how does the math work, but given a problem, how do I give my","agent this heuristic upgrade?","","Most of the work involved in solving hard search problems is actually","coming up with a heuristic in the first place.","So for the example of Romania here, the admissible heuristics come from","what are called relaxed problems.","What's a relaxed problem?","What it means is we take our original problem, which is hard, and it's","difficult to compute how far we actually are from the goal.","And we change the problem in such a way that we have only made things the","same or easier.","The idea is in this new problem it's easy to find cost to the goal.","They'll just be cheaper because we've made the problem easier.","For example, if we imagined in Romania, in addition to the roads we","actually have, we've also got a straight line road straight to the","solution, in this case Bucharest.","Well, that would be an easier problem.","It can't take any longer with the presence of these new roads.","And in this new problem, we don't even have to run search.","We just know you always take the direct road.","It's kind of a convoluted way to come up with the straight line distance,","but it illustrates this idea that by taking our problem and making it","easier we get lower bounds on the costs in the harder problem.","Here's another case that you've already seen.","Manhattan distance for the Pac-Man problem.","What is the relaxation here?","We say, well, I don't know how far I am from the goal given all those walls","and the going back and forth.","But if I could change the problem so that Pac-Man could walk through walls,","well, it's easy to figure out the quickest way.","You just go straight there.","And so that's a relaxation of the problem, which essentially involves","adding new operators.","But, in general, though you can then solve this new problem with search, in","general, you add operators such that you know the solution more or less in","closed form.","Sometimes, we actually use inadmissible heuristics.","So if you come up with a heuristic and it works really well in practice, and","you discover every now and then it over estimates, well you have no","guarantee of optimality.","You also don't have a guarantee of sub optimality.","And for many problems a little bit sub optimal sometimes is worth a huge","increase in speed.","And sometimes, a little bit of inadmissibility, not in and of itself,","but because it lets you be more aggressive with heuristic, is","sometimes worth it.","But for now, we're going to worry about creating admissible heuristics.","So we're going to talk through an example where we can come up with","multiple heuristics.","It's the example of the eight puzzle.","So here's the eight puzzle.","You start with a puzzle, like what's in the upper left in some start state.","Your actions are you can move a square with a number in it into the blank","square if its adjacent.","So what the robot's doing here, you can move the eight rightward if","there's no other tile right.","The goal is to end up in this configuration, where the","numbers are in order.","How many of you have played with an eight puzzle?","Yeah, did you like it?","These things were a hit once.","This is like the Xbox 100 years ago.","We have a search problem.","We have states.","They're configurations of numbers.","In fact, they're kind of a list of numbers, so it's a permutation.","How many of them are there?","We could do some combinatorics.","It's going to be the number of these factorials, so it's a lot of states.","What are the actions?","Well, the actions are any of the adjacent squares to the","blank can be moved.","What are the successors?","Well, you compute the appropriate permutation.","What's the branching factor like?","For example, from the start state here how many successors do I have?","Well, I can move this one.","I can move this one.","I can move this one.","I can move this one.","I've got four successor from the start state.","So it's not a huge branching factor, but it's going to be a pretty big tree","before it's all done.","What's should our costs be?","Well.","Maybe it's more expensive to move the eight, but probably not.","So let's say the costs are all one.","So in that case, we're just trying to find a solution of minimum cost, which","means of fewest steps.","So we've got our search problem.","And we can point at a breadth first search.","And breadth first search we'll truck away.","We can point at Uniform Cost Search.","And Uniform Cost Search we'll truck away.","Because the costs are one, they'll do more or less the same thing.","We want a heuristic, so we can do things faster.","So here's one heuristic.","Let's count up the number of tiles that are not in","their destination position.","Is this a heuristic?","Does it take a state and return a real number?","Sure.","What real number does it return?","Well, we can look at the start state here, and we can say, well, this one","is out of position.","And this one's out of position.","And they're actually all out of position.","So this one's going to return eight.","Why is that admissible?","Why is it the case that I can't possibly be closer than eight steps?","Why can't I come up with some genius brilliant eight puzzle move that gets","them all in order in one step?","The answer is it's not how the eight puzzle works.","You move one tile at a time.","And when you move that tile, it either goes into its final","position or it doesn't.","There's no move that can fix two squares at once, assuming we treat the","blank appropriately.","And so it's admissible because every move in the optimal solution either","fixes one of these mistakes, or doesn't, but it can't","fix more than one.","So the heuristic of the start is eight.","We might in fact be 15 away at the start, but we're not more than eight.","So there's an admissible heuristic.","Does it work?","Well, how much work we do is going to depend actually on how deep the","optimal path is in the tree.","If this thing's really scrambled, we have to go deep into the","tree to find the path.","If it's not very scrambled, then lots of search techniques are going to work","reasonably well.","So Uniform Cost Search versus this misplaced tiles heuristic is shown.","And you can see that at the beginning the differences isn't so great, but as","we get deeper into the tree in order to find our optimal path, this tree","grows exponentially.","And so you can see that Uniform Cost Search just does not keep up with A","star using even this simple heuristic.","Only 227 versus 3 times 10 to the sixth.","This is a relaxed problem heuristic.","It is the exact solution, so eight is the exact cost of the exact solution","to an easier version of the eight puzzle.","What is the easier version of the eight puzzle that you can actually","solve in eight steps?","Well, if you could remove the pieces.","If you could, in every step, take some piece and put in the right place, that","can't make this problem be any more expensive.","And we know how long it's going to be to solve it.","We know it's going to take eight steps.","So here's an extreme relaxation of the problem.","It gives rise to an admissible heuristic.","But it's a very loose heuristic.","It's an extreme relaxation.","We're probably a lot farther than eight.","Can we come up with a better heuristic?","Well, maybe.","What if we had an easier version of the eight puzzle, not so easy that","you've ripped it apart and you can fix each one in one step.","But what if each tile was simply independent.","It was a vertical puzzle.","They were all on their own track and they could slide past each other.","This would be easier because we would have all the moves we currently have","that are legal, plus some more that involve sliding tiles","on top of each other.","And in this case, how far am I?","In this case, all of the tiles are independent.","So how hard is it to get the one into position in this easier problem?","I can't do it in one step.","How much is it going to take?","One to the left, two up, it's three away.","And so what I could do is I could basically add up all","the Manhattan distances.","Now that doesn't actually solve the real problem for me, but","it's a lower bounds.","And it's probably better than the previous one.","So let's take a look.","This is the total Manhattan distance.","We know why it's admissible.","","Actually, there's two ways you can show it's admissible.","This is worth pointing out.","One is by illustrating the relaxed problem, like I did.","And then arguing that it is, in fact, a strict relaxation.","And the other way is just from first principle saying, well, here's why you","can't possibly do any better than that.","And you always have these two routes, direct proof or construction of a","relaxation.","So we already computed would the h to the start is.","And it turns out to be 18.","That's a lot better than eight.","It tells us, in fact, we weren't even so close as eight.","We're at least 18 away, and probably further than that.","Is it better?","For shallow problems, its actually not much better.","But by the time you get to deeper problems, it's substantially better","than the tiles heuristic.","And this illustrates a general point that as your heuristic gets tighter,","as it gets closer to the true cost, you do less work.","And that's actually a deep fact about A star.","As the heuristic gets closer to the true cost, you'll do less work.","","Forget all these relaxed problems.","I have a heuristic for you.","We're going to look at a state and we're going to actually figure out how","far we are from the solution.","It's possible.","We have a search problem, we can find this number.","Is that a heuristic?","Yes.","Would it be admissible?","Yes, trivially admissible.","Would we save on the number of nodes we expanded in the search?","Yeah, you basically go straight down optimal paths only.","OK, so, why did I tell you about these other heuristics?","What's wrong with using the actual cost as a heuristic?","It looks great.","","It's kind of expensive to compute.","So even though you don't expand many nodes, each one launches a search","problem that's as hard as the thing you were trying to speed up in the","first place.","So with A star there's this general point.","In general, there's a trade off between the quality of your estimate,","the tightness of your heuristic, and the amount of work you","have to do per node.","And the way that looks like is better heuristics mean you expand fewer nodes","because they tend to be tighter.","On the other hand, each node is expensive because you have to do the","extra work to compute the heuristic itself.","You'll see this in your project ones.","As your heuristics are sufficiently good, you may actually see slowdowns","in your wall clock time.","So basically, there's going to be a family of heuristics.","Some of them are really bad.","That just always tell you you're there.","And some of them are really good.","They know exactly what you should do.","And some of them are in between.","And usually the sweet spot is in between.","You don't want your heuristic to be clueless, but fast.","Because then you're basically not exploiting A star.","You don't want it to be so good that it's solving the problem because then","probably you're wasting your time.","And somewhere in between is usually a good balance.",""]}
