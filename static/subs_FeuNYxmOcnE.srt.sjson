So now we're going to talk about what exactly is this object","mathematically, and what are some algorithms for solving this problem","that we've formulated?","And one nice thing is there's this line here.","You formulate the search problem, and that's very problem specific.","And then you solve it.","Solving the search problem does not actually require knowledge of whether","or not there are power pellets or how they work.","All that's encoded in an abstracted way in the start state and the","successor function, and so on.","So all our algorithms for solution are going to reference things like the","successor function and the goal test, not things like scared timers.","All right.","So what is a state space?","Well, it's basically a graph.","And we can draw this state space graph, which is a mathematical","representation of our search problem.","So for the case of Pac-Man eating dots, it might look like this, right?","There's a bunch of different states you can be in, and they're connected","by actions.","These actions have labels, north, south, east, and","west that I've omitted.","This graph is quite big, even for a modest size board, because different","dot configurations for this search problem are different.","And so here's a very large search state space graph.","The nodes are going to be some abstraction of world configurations.","The more you can abstract, all else equal, the more efficient","your search will be.","The arcs represent the successors, so the successor function here is encoded","in the arts.","From any given state, my successor function returns my neighbors in the","graph in a directed sense.","The goal test isn't shown in the graph, right?","Graphs have nodes and arcs, and weights and things like that.","The goal test isn't shown on the graph.","It's another thing you have to get to have a search problem, and it's a set","of goal nodes, or a function over goal nodes that tell you when you're done.","Similarly, you need to know the start.","","So an important point that will become more important and confusable later.","In this search graph, each state occurs only once.","So for example, let's say this is your start state here.","And let's say we're considering this state here.","There are a couple ways to get there.","Actually, for this state up here there are kind of infinitely many ways to","get there, right?","Just walk back and forth.","OK, there are a lot of different ways to get to these states, but the state","occurs only once in this graph.","Very, very critical distinction.","In a search graph, each state occurs once, regardless of the number of","paths through the graph that can get to it.","","In general, this graph is a nice mathematical object.","We can think about it, but we don't build it, right?","Because it's exponentially big.","We try to avoid building things that are exponentially big.","And in general we can't build it, we can't fit it in memory, we don't have","enough time to build it.","It's a useful idea, but it is just an idea.","We don't actually build the whole thing and then search it, for example.","","For the purposes of this lecture next, we're going to be playing with this","tiny little search problem.","When you see a search problem that fits on a PowerPoint slide, in general","you should laugh inside at the tiny little funny search problem.","Because a real search problem never fits on a PowerPoint slide.","If they were like this, there would be no lecture here.","It would be just enumerate everything and whatever, right?","The idea is we have this graph, and we'd like to somehow find paths in","this graph, optimal solutions without ever writing most of the graph down.","That's the trick.","","So what do we do?","Well, we don't want to write down the whole graph, because most of it's not","relevant to us.","What is relevant to us?","The start state's relevant to us, and the things that can happen from here","are relevant to us.","So the object that we work with is what's called a search tree.","And this object will also have problems.","What is a search tree?","Well, at the top of the tree is the current state.","This is now.","This is the start state.","What can happen next?","Well, we have our actions, and below that we have possible futures.","Right below the start state is what can happen in one step, and that just","continues on down.","And the deeper you go, you're just traveling into the future.","It's like science fiction.","So this is essentially the tree of what if.","Every plan you could possibly execute is in this tree somewhere.","The start state is the root.","Children correspond to successors.","Each node in this graph has a state that it corresponds to.","But it's really a plan.","So this node here, although it looks a lot like this search state, it's","actually more than that.","It's the plan of being in the start state and going north,","and ending up there.","There are other ways to end up in this.","For example, you could go north and then south and then north, and that's","down here somewhere.","It has the same state, but it's elsewhere in the tree, because nodes","in this tree correspond to plans, not states.","Critical distinction.","Again, I told you we don't build the graph.","Well, we don't build the tree either.","Tree is at least as bad as the graph.","So what's the point?","The point is, we try to just build a tiny little piece of this tree, and we","try to have algorithms that guarantee we did the right thing even though we","ignored most of the tree.","That's going to be the tree."]}
