Now, some ancestor of A","must be on the fringe.","Maybe it's A itself, but maybe not.","In any case, let's call n the ancestor of A that's on the fringe.","The claim we're going to show is that n will be expanded by A star search","before B. If n is expanded before B, then n's child will be expanded before","B, all the way down to A, and then eventually A will be expanded before","B.","First, let's look at n versus A. And the claim is that f of n is less than","or equal to f of A. Why is this?","Let's take a look.","First, what is f of n?","By the definition of f cost for A star, that's equal to g of n, its path","cost, plus h of n, the heuristic at n.","But we know that h is admissible.","And for an admissible heuristic, h cannot overestimate the cost to a","closest goal, such as A. That means that f of n is less than or equal to g","of A, the path cost of A itself.","Because h is zero at a goal, g of A and f of A are the same.","Putting all this together, we get that f of n is less than or equal to f of","A.","Next, we'll compare A and B. And we'll show that f of A is less than f of B.","Why is that true?","Well, we know that g of A, A's path cost, is less than g","of B, B's path cost.","That's because we assumed that B is suboptimal, and that's what it means","to be suboptimal.","Again, because h equals zero for an admissible heuristic at any goal, we","also know that f of A is less than f of B.","The third thing we have to notice is that n will expand before","B. Now, why is that?","Well, if we compare n and B, then we'll see if we put these inequalities","together that f of n is less than or equal to f of A, which is less than f","of B. And so f of n is less than f of B.","That means the A star algorithm will choose to remove n before it moves B","from the queue.","Of course, this holds not only for n, but for any node along the path","towards A. That means that all ancestors of A will expand before B.","And in turn, that means A itself will expand before B. Since we've just","shown that any optimal node will be removed before any suboptimal node,","that means that A star search is optimal because the first goal node","that it returns will be optimal.",""]}
