All right.","How are we going to use the heuristic?","Well, the first thing that occurs you is, well, I have this arrow, in some","sense, that tells me whether or not I'm close to the goal.","Why don't we just follow the heuristic?","And you can.","That's Greedy Search.","And as you might imagine from the name, it's not a perfect solution.","Let's figure out what it looks like.","In Greedy Search, you look at your map.","So for example, let's say we're at Arad again.","So we start here.","And we're trying to get to Bucharest.","And we're going to follow the heuristic in some way.","Now, it's not going to be hill climbing.","It's not going to be a local search.","It's going to still be a fringe.","It's just the things that come out of the fringe will be prioritized, based","on whether or not they seem to be close to the goal.","And so let's look at this map for a second.","So we can understand the example.","All right.","The actual shortest path is what I call the low road,","through Rimnicu Vilcea.","The high road, through Fagaras, is longer.","Depth First Search would like it because it has fewer steps.","But Uniform Cost would do the right thing and return the low road.","Because the sum of the path cost is lower.","OK.","So remember that.","The one through Fagaras is longer.","And it makes more progress, quickly.","Fagaras itself is closer to Bucharest.","But it's the wrong answer.","So Greedy Search, you expand the node that seems to be closest.","So let's say you were at Arad.","And that has distance 366, according to our heuristic.","We expand it.","And onto our fringe go the three places you can get to in","one step, from Arad.","And you can see here that Sibiu, which in fact is the right direction to","head, is closest.","Now, all three are on our Fringe.","But we're going to do Sibiu first.","So we expand that.","And now, we've got this Fringe that has a bunch of stuff on it.","It's got some crazy stuff, like going back to a Arad.","We probably shouldn't do that.","But the thing on the entire Fringe that's closest is Fagaras.","Because it makes immediate progress.","However, the right answer, through the low road, is not yet cheaper.","Because it gets there kind of in more steps.","And it doesn't look cheaper, yet.","So what do we do in Greedy Search?","We go through Fagaras.","Now, the problem is, once we go through Fagaras, now","we can see the goal.","We can see Bucharest.","We're going to go straight there.","And this good path that would actually have been cheap, had we kind of","checked it out.","It didn't look good right away.","And it's still on the Fringe.","We would eventually come back to it, if it were the only path.","But we end up picking the high road.","And therefore, we drive farther.","So what can go wrong with Greedy Search?","Well, what can go wrong is you don't get the thing you wanted.","You end up with some kind of goal.","But it's not the cheapest.","","All right.","So how does Greedy Search work?","Well, all I have to really do is tell you the strategy.","And you've got the algorithm.","I don't need to go through Tree Search again.","The strategy is expand a goal, that you think is","closest to the goal state.","Which means, in code, you take the state that node corresponds to.","You execute the heuristic on it. the heuristic is in general code, not a","Lookup Table.","You execute the heuristic.","You take the number.","And that's your priority.","The thing with the lowest number, at any given time, comes off.","Unlike Uniform Cost, which looked at cumulative costs, this","is a one-shot number.","You don't add up your heuristics.","And you always go kind of towards whatever appears to be","closest to the goal.","Now, a common case is that this kind of Best-First, Greedy Search will take","you straight to a goal.","But it will be the wrong one.","So I have this image in my head here, where you go straight","down into the tree.","And in general, unlike Depth First Search, where you go straight off into","some crazy left-door way, you're going straight in some basically reasonable","way, especially if your heuristic is really good.","And so you get to a goal.","But it may not be the right goal.","So it's deep like Depth First Research.","But it's not kind of completely rogue, like Depth First Search.","Now, on the other hand, you're heuristic could play games with you.","It could tell you that everything is close to the goal, except the things","that are actually close to the goal.","And then what happens?","Well, then you go on this goose chase.","And you expand the entire tree, except the part you want.","So really, Greedy is only as good as your heuristic.","And in general, heuristics aren't perfect.","And this thing on the bottom doesn't always happen.","But it certainly can, if your heuristic isn't very good.","You can think of Greedy, basically, as having all the properties of Depth","First Search.","Except that Depth First Search is guided.","And it's maybe guided well.","So let's look at what this looks like in execution.","","Sometimes, it looks great.","So if I look at the empty water--","remember how Uniform Cost Search checked every direction?","What does Greedy do?","AUDIENCE: When it works, it works.","PROFESSOR: When it works it works, right.","","How about--","what does Greedy Search do in the case of that maze?","Well, here you can see what it did.","It's actually pretty interesting.","It expanded, unsurprisingly, things that seemed to make progress.","And then, at that point, going left seem to make progress.","So it expanded all of this.","Then, it couldn't get any closer.","The things that looked closest were actually kind of curling back.","So it expanded these next.","Those did not work.","Rather than declaring failure-- it's not a local search.","This other stuff was still on the fringe.","And so it did eventually come back and expand all that stuff.","Now, what's the problem?","The problem is, well, it avoided the worst possible outcome, which is just","not even finding a solution.","It did know to backtrack, in some sense, meaning take things off the","fringe and try again.","But in fact, the optimal solution goes right here and then straight down.","The problem with Greedy here is, the right solution actually goes","backwards, according to the heuristic, very briefly,","before it can make progress.","Greedy is not OK with that.",""]}
