KLEIN: So we've just talked about what a CSP is.","We've seen various kinds of CSPs and how to formulate them, and now we're","going to talk about methods for solving them.","The first thing you might think of is, well, it's a sub case of search.","Let's just use search.","And there is a standard way of solving CSPs with search that is going to be","the primary method we solve them.","So in the standard search formulation, we still have states.","We still goal tests and so on.","What are the states?","The states are defined by the values that are assigned so far, and that","means a state is a partial assignment.","The initial state in the search problem is the empty assignment, where","no values have been assigned to any variables.","The successor function for a given partial assignment assigns a value to","a single unassigned variable, so it extends that","assignment by one variable.","And the goal test is, is the current assignment complete?","That is, do all variables have values assigned to them?","And are all constraints satisfied?","So if we do, this will be our first straightforward approach.","It's not going to work very well by itself, but we'll improve it","incrementally.","So let's test and make sure we understand this search problem.","So here's the case of Australia shown in the applet.","I'm going to show you a different graph in a demo, but first let's think","for the case of Australia.","What would breadth first search do?","Let's think about it.","What's at the root of the tree?","The root of the tree is some state, which is nothing assigned.","What are the children of that state?","Right.","They're all single assignments, right?","Each of these has one assignment, like V equals red.","Right.","And there's a bunch of them.","And the children of V equals red are a bunch of other assignments, which","include V equals red and one more.","What's breadth first search going to do in this tree?","It's going to try the top layer.","And then the second layer.","Is it going to find anything the second layer?","No.","It's going to try the third layer, and the fourth layer.","And where are all the solutions?","They're all at the bottom.","Breadth first search stays up at night, kind of worrying about cases","like this, where the solutions are all at the bottom, meaning it has to","search the entire tree before it even has a chance of finding that last","layer with the solutions in it.","All right, so breadth first search is kind of in trouble here.","It's kind of the worst possible case for breadth first search.","So, what would depth first search do?","Starts at the top, right?","Empty assignment.","It goes down.","It assigns something.","From there, it's going to take that deeper assignment, and assign","something else, and then something else, and something else.","And it's going to zip straight down the tree, and it's going to very","quickly find a complete assignment.","Now, who knows whether that assignment's in fact going to pass the","goal test, right?","It may not actually satisfy the constraints.","But at least depth first search is making an effort towards getting where","the solutions are.","So we mocked depth first search in the last unit, but now suddenly we're","seeing why we cover it at all.","In the case where all the solutions are at the bottom, and you're going to","spend most of your time managing that, depth first search is a great choice.","So let's see depth first search, this wonderful choice in action.","Again, this is a map coloring case.","So right now this is the empty assignment, and in depth first search,","we're going to start assigning one variable.","And then the next, and then the next, according to our exploration strategy.","And so what gets assigned first?","Well, let's say we start in the lower left.","So first we would assign, for example, blue.","Now, remember in depth first search, there are still other options that are","on the stack, or on the fringe.","But this is the one we're going to recurse into first.","All right, so what do we assign next?","Well, let's say it's the middle one on the bottom.","And what will we assign it?","Well, you know, we're going to call the successor function, and behold,","we'll assign it blue.","OK.","What happens next?","You think, oh, maybe we backtrack.","Wrong.","Right.","What happens in depth first search is you call the successor function.","And guess who has successors?","Successors.","Successors.","And so, depth first search is going to all the way to the end.","It's going to realize this doesn't have any successors.","It's going to pull the next thing off, and then the next thing, and then the","next thing.","And so you can keep this up.","I'll speed this thing up, and it's going to kind of","explore a bunch of stuff.","And you know, depth first search is going to spend a lot of time.","And in some sense, this is all just wasted, because when","did it make its mistake?","Like instantly, right?","So depth first research is going to spend a lot of time.","I'm not even going to let this continue.","So that's that.","OK, so something's wrong here.","There's actually a couple things wrong here.","And let's fix it.","So for naive search, there's actually a couple problems we're going to have","to fix before we're even going to have a hope of applying this to any","reasonable problem.",""]}
