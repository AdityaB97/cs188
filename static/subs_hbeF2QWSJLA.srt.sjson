And in","this case, that shortest path also has cost four.","So here, h equals four is admissible in this case.","What we need for A star graph search to be correct is the stronger notion","of consistency.","Consistency says that the heuristic cost must be less than or equal to the","actual cost for each arc, not just the path towards the goal.","So what does that look like?","It looks at a single arc, and it says, OK here's a real arc, which has cost","one in this case.","If the real cost is one, what is the cost of this arc","according to the heuristic?","Well, heuristics don't actually score arcs.","But if you think about it, if the heuristic is four at A, and it's one","at C, like in our example, then really if you look at the heuristic, it looks","like this arc cost three.","In particular, you can look at the difference in heuristic value from A","to C and say that that difference must be less than or equal to the actual","cost from A to C. That is consistency.","Now, in this case, where A star went wrong, we can see that this arc is not","consistent.","h equals four is admissible, and so is h equals one, but because the","heuristic implies a cost of three, where the real arc only costs one,","this is not a consistent heuristic.","To make it consistent, we could lower h.","For example, we could make h equal two at A. And now we have","a consistent heuristic.","If you went back and ran the same example with this change to the","heuristic, you would get the correct optimal result from A star.","What are the consequences of consistency?","Well, one consequence is that the f value along the","path will never decrease.","Why is that?","If you go from a parent A to a child C, then at A you added in h of A, the","heuristic A. And at C, you add in the cost from A to C and then the","heuristic value at C.","Consistency, by simple rewriting, guarantees that that is an increase.","The result of this is that A star graph search is optimal.","","Why is A star graph search going to be optimal with a consistent heuristic?","We'll sketch the proof.","First, let's consider what A star does when it has a consistent heuristic.","The first fact is that because of consistency, A star will expand nodes","in increasing total f value.","The second fact is that for every state S, nodes that reach S optimally","are expanded before nodes that reach S suboptimally.","","Once we have these two facts proven, we'll have the result that A star","graph search is optimal because in particular, fact two will","hold at goal states.",""]}
